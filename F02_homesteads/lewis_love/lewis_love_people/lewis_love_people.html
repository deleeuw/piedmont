He had a long, rich, and active life. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">If I had enough time and energy left I could probably write a 250-page book about Lewis Love and his immediate family, but I have many more Piedmont history chapters to write. &nbsp;I am just mentioning the potential Lewis Love book to show how much happened during his life, and how much material there still is.</span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Even for my more limited project there is much more documentation I have to go through than for Ulery, Fenstermacher, Smith, and Howe combined. Love had many children, who largely remained in the Portland area, and generated many newspaper items of their own. He had much more land in his donation land claim than the others, because he was married and arrived in Oregon early. He also lived longer, and he was involved in multiple minor and major lawsuits, which also generated a lot of coverage. So this promises to be a rather long chapter, with much biographical detail. </span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">There will be separate sections on the members of his immediate family, his wife and children.</span></p><p class="c5"><span>Because this book concentrates on real property transactions, we only discuss the children, because after the death of Lewis Love they almost immediately got rid of his land. The grandchildren were no longer involved in selling tracts and subdividing neighborhoods. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, not much is known about his wife and the daughters. Their assigned role in life was to marry young, get a lot of children, and &ldquo;</span><span class="c17">keep house</span><span class="c6">&rdquo;. There are some minor exceptions, but generally it&rsquo;s patriarchy throughout.</span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>One more introductory remark. The modern Piedmont neighborhood tends to be identified with the original Piedmont subdivision of 1888. For example, the motto of the Piedmont Neighborhood Association is taken from the brochures of the Investment Company, the logo is either the bandstand in Peninsula Park, right next to original Piedmont, or the water tower that the Investment Company built for the Piedmont subdivision. But the part of the Piedmont subdivision that is in the Piedmont neighborhood is only about ten to fifteen percent of the neighborhood area, while the </span><span class="c16"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/open?id%3D1PJwAeNdPVCGvF1cwHkIhh5KFsL5H21sO63urXibqZtQ&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1630355150121000&amp;usg=AOvVaw26pkbHSUGMrJI_ZQ-Ny1F-">Lewis Love DLC</a></span><span class="c6">&nbsp;is at least half of the Piedmont neighborhood. A pretty good case could be made for changing the name of the Piedmont neighborhood to the Love neighborhood, or simply to Lewis Love.</span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Of course it is true that the southern part of the neighborhood, below Bryant, is among the oldest parts and was certainly initially the most affluent. But one of the main reasons for this is that Lewis Love did not sell or develop any of his acreage, and that development north of Bryant only started more than twenty years after Piedmont was platted and developed. In those twenty years North Portland built the Swift meat packing plant, and many other industries, and the people working in those plants needed housing. That created demand for a different type of housing than the homes for comparatively well-off people fleeing the rowdy and immoral West Side. </span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>To some extent this chapter tries to remedy an unfortunate situation. The Sunday Oregonian of &nbsp;January 7, 2008 had a nice article about Lewis Love in John Terry&rsquo;s </span><span class="c17">Oregon&rsquo;s Trails</span><span>&nbsp;series with the title: </span><span class="c17">Pioneer&rsquo;s name all but forgotten in public domain. </span><span class="c6">Here it is:</span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c16 c17"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/open?id%3D14LskwYekRmv3OS0hftxd73F-VIn6Hxwe&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1630355150123000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0hj5ETqYq80OnWnj_rSSpp">https://drive.google.com/open?id=14LskwYekRmv3OS0hftxd73F-VIn6Hxwe</a></span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Although the piece is useful, it has several errors. As we have seen, the southern boundary of Love&rsquo;s property in North/Northeast Portland was not Lombard but Bryant. Although there may not be a great deal of Love memorabilia left standing downtown, the names of the Piedmont subdivisions certainly have a lot of Love in them. I guess John Terry, together with the rest of the Oregonian, tends to pay more attention to the other side of the Willamette. This also explains why Lewis Love was &ldquo;all but forgotten&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Portland history, like most local history, tends to concentrate on the people who started living in the town center, were active in public life, flaunted their riches, donated stuff, and advertised their name. Lewis Love amassed his fortune in a rather unspectacular and fairly modest way. Although he was active on the west side, and actually lived on First Street and Front Street for a long time, his most important accomplishments were in Washington Territory, on the Columbia River, and in North and Northeast Portland. And events in those areas were inherently less visible than those on the west side. His children stayed on the east side and platted and developed his huge land holdings there. Although it is true that Lewis Love does not feature prominently in Portland history books such as the ones by McCall, Abbott, and Lansing, his name does live on in the names of the subdivisions Loveleigh, Lovewood, Love&rsquo;s Addition, and the Green C. Love Addition.</span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>I hope this chapter shows how Captain Love&rsquo;s trajectory, starting poor and becoming rich, was ultimately based on huge swatches of stolen lands given away by the US government. &nbsp;The purpose of this generosity was to attract settlers from the East to replace Native Americans and to finalize discovery and manifest destiny claims. Within this framework, which is of course basically corrupt, Lewis Love was a remarkable man. He saw and took opportunities that were offered to white people at the time, creating and abandoning businesses when appropriate, never being discouraged by disaster, using and misusing the law, and having a truly incredible amount of physical and mental power and energy. And, throughout, he saw and emphasized the value of land. Holding on for more than 50 years to his 700 acres in North and Northeast Portland, and not selling any of it during his lifetime, was definitely a prudent decision. And above all it was very family-friendly, because ultimately it greatly benefited all his children and grandchildren.</span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h2 class="c21 c22" id="h.c1cb22umroz6"><span class="c27"></span></h2><h1 class="c40" id="h.6tluow88nkpu"><span class="c33">Life</span></h1><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>In November 1899 Captain Lewis Love sat down with his granddaughter Harriet LaVelle Peacher and dictated a manuscript with the details of his trek across the plains from Missouri to Oregon, and about his subsequent activities and enterprises in Oregon and Washington.

They are reproduced here in total, because we will use them as the starting point for much of the chapter. As you will see, a great deal of attention is paid to Love&rsquo;s travels on the Oregon Trail, which probably was the most exciting period of his life, although surely not the most profitable one.

After</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">living there till he was 15 years of age he moved to Fox River Co., Illinois</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in the year 1833. From there he moved to Missouri in 1845 and crossed the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">plains to come West in 1849. His mother was part Pennsylvania Dutch and part</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yankee; she was born in New York and her name before she was married was Jane</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Demont (deMott). She was the mother of 6 boys and 2 girls all of which are</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dead (Nov. 1899) except Captain Lewis Love.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mrs. Love, Captain Lewis Love&#39;s wife was born in Tennessee, near a little</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">town called Spy and moved to Illinois in 1833 where she met Mr. Love and they</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were married in 1836.

(1), and when they got thirty miles north of Ft. Scott,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they came to high water called the Osage River.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was only three families together at that time, so they went to</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">work putting in timbers to make a raft to cross on about 2:00 P.M. Two</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cherokee Indians rode up and asked us what we were doing. They were on</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">their way to the gold fields in California. We told them we were putting</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in timbers to build a raft to cross the high water, so they said for us to</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">turn our teams out and their train would come up that evening with 35</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wagons and 85 men. So we waited till next morning, then went to work</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">building the raft.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">We got it all together in good shape in a stream called </span><span class="c13">Sugar Creek (2)</span><span class="c1">, this</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">being backwater from the Osage River. We floated down to the Osage so as</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to be able to cross both streams at once. There we found the river to be</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">very swift, too much so to hold against the current. Then we wondered how</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">we was going to cross. Finally Capt, Love suggested that we take</span><span class="c24 c13">&nbsp;grapevines (3)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and make ropes. Two or three of the Indians kept interfering till the main</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">body drove the others off and told them to stay until it was time for them</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to cross. Capt. Love took one man with him and they pounded the vines till</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they could be beat to make a cable. They made a cable to reach a quarter</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of a mile and forked it down near the raft to keep it from swinging around</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">so as to pull across straight. We then swam over and took ropes to pull</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">us in the direction we wanted to go. We put one wagon on the raft at a</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time and each trip the raft would sink knee deep till we struck the swift-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">est part of the river, then the raft would rise on top and float from there</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">over. We commenced taking things across at 2:00 P.M. and that night at</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">10:00 P.M. everything was over safe. From that on the Cherokees became so</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">much attached to me they would ride three or four miles to see me.</span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Soon afterwards Cholera set in and it was not uncommon for four or five</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cases to be reported in camp, the Cherokees being about the heaviest suf-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ferers according to the number, and they died off very fast.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Ninth Regiment that crossed the plains that year took them in tow and</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">kept them for several hundred miles until they were able to take care of</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the teams themselves, then they were discharged. And the last I saw of</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them was on South Pass in the Rocky Mts. They rode past us four miles and</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">drove back to bid me farewell.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not long after we left the Osage River we came to a bluff where we had to</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">let the wagons down by means of trees and ropes. Some of the trees had</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gashes cut in them fully two inches from letting down so many wagons. We</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">had not traveled far when an axle broke in one of the wagons so we went</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">along up the canyon a ways till we came to some ash trees. We hewed a</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">piece of ash down and made another axle.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One morning while we were camping at a place called Potowatammy, I went</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">out to hunt up the cattle. When I found them there were 41 missing. The</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">word came that Indians were seen driving them away up the road, The man</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that was with me wanted to go that way to find them. I told him, No, it</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was a hook (hoax) to keep us from finding them. I told him I was too well</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">acquainted with the Indians to believe they would steal my cattle. So we</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">struck across the plains about four miles to a high ridge which had quite</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a stream of water at the foot of it. There I saw three squaws riding across</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the plains. I hailed them, and as I could talk a little of their language,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I asked them if they had seen any cattle. So they motioned up over the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ridge where there was three men herding them and just ready to start off</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with them. I wanted to know of them what they were doing with those cattle,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and they said they was sent back by a train about four miles ahead to gather</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them up. I told them it was no such a thing for my cattle were all branded</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and there was the brand to show for itself. They had 13 head of oxen of</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mine which would have left me only one to work. When we got to Ft. Carney</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">(Kearney) I took a man by the name of Miller in the train to assist. The</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rule was that two men was to stand guard every night and when it came my</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">turn he never would let me go but he would take my place. When we got</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pretty well to Ft. Laramie there was five men and a wagon came into the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">train. One of the men was a great big stout fellow and to let him tell</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it he could whip all the Indians on the plains. They took a &nbsp;notion one</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">day, quite a number, that he was a coward and along towards night he was</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pointing out how many pony tracks there was. So they thought they would</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">play a joke on him. It was his night to be on duty, and of course if any</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indians came around they knew he would shoot them. One old man in their</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wagon called &quot;Pap&quot; on account of his age told him he had been an old front-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">iersman and would like to load his gun for him. So it was loaded with a</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">paper wad, After supper the two men went out on guard. The second man had</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">been informed of the joke so he was all ready for them. A while later five</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">men went out, three of whom had guns, and went around in behind the men and</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">two of them commenced patting on their knees to draw his attention. His</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bravery left him very suddenly and, making the best speed possible for the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">camp, told them the Indians were after him and he had come for help. Next</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">morning quite a crowd gathered around in one wagon, and were talking about</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the Indians&#39; attack and one person asked him how many Indians he really</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thought there was. He said there was 25 or 30 in front and they occupied a</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">piece of ground the shape of a flatiron, and back of this number their heads</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stuck up as thick as they could be.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After we crossed South Platte, apast Ft. Laramie, two or three days&#39; ride,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">we stopped to noon one day. While we were eating, two men came back a-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">horseback. They were in haste and wanted us to drive on as they wanted help.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The time came for the train to start and several more trains drove up and a</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">German man belonging to one of the trains was very much excited over the re-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">port of the Indians and went on to tell how they would kill us. I went up</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to him and put my hand on his shoulder and told him he must not talk that way</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">because he was frightening the women and children. He says, &quot;You are right&quot;,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and you could hardly hear another word out of him after that. When we got</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">straightened around ready to start, we traveled about two miles, when we</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">found we had to turn around and come back about five miles. We started down</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ash Canyon. After going down some distance the same two men came riding</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">back further up on the offside of the teams, yelling for the women and</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">children to get into the wagons, that the Indians were advancing. The men</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">reported 1500 to 2000 Indians. They came on around where I was and I stepped</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">out and told them the same as I told the German man, and if they didn&#39;t stop</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would knock them off their horses. As soon as they passed on, I took my</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gun and went to see what there was over the hill. &lsquo;Iwo women went with me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We went to the top of the hill. There we stopped and estimated about 75 or</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">80 Indians out of the 1500 or 2000. &lsquo;Then we went back down the hill and met</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">our teams. We then reported the number of Indians. A great many would not</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">believe us on account of the large number being reported before. We then</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">drove on out to the mouth of the canyon, having about 80 horsemen in front,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">well-armed. When we got down to where the Indians were we rode on down</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">amongst them and found everything very peaceful after all the scare. It</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was a remnant of the Sioux tribe who had just been engaged in a battle with</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a tribe called the Blackfeet. I wanted to know of those fellows after the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">trains had stopped, why they had made so much fuss about the Indians. They</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">said one Indian made a mark across the road in the dust. Those were the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">first Indians we had seen since leaving the Potowatammy tribe, so many</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indians had left the trail on account of the Whites and we only saw a few</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">buffalo.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Close to Independence Rock, which was literally covered with names, quite a</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">number of people had gathered together. One train of 52 wagons and car-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">riages drove up which took passengers and freight. That train held a meet~</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ing and decided to throw out 1,000 pounds of freight, some offering a dol-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">lar a pound to get it hauled through. They went to work unloading the freight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Amongst other things there was quite a large quantity of powder. They took</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it and poured it in a circle around quite a large piece of ground out of the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">kegs; then put a fuse to it and burnt the circle in that way, and a great</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">many articles that was supposed to have been thrown out were shipped in other</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wagons.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that we came to a great many places where wagons and buggies were left</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">standing different places on the plains. One instance I unhitched from a</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">2-horse wagon and left it standing with the cover on. I asked the people if</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they objected to my leaving mine and taking the other one. They said no, I</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was welcome to it, so I changed the load and left my wagon standing with the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cover on.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a very common thing for the oxen to get sore feet. So we would take</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a piece of skin from a dead ox and sew it around the sore feet to keep the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sand from getting into them. Nothing more of much importance occurred till</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">we struck the Black Hills. Two men had gone ahead to find a camping place</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">at the foot of the Black Hills, and when they got there they reported no</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">grass to be found -- nothing but sagebrush. They said we would have to tie</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">our cattle up with nothing to eat. I got on my mule and asked if any man</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would go with me to hunt grass. It was in the P.M. We struck out for a</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">high rocky ridge. When we got about 2/3 of the way to it, the Irishman</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">would not go any further. He said there was no use. I went about a mile</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and then had to get off my muie and walk, it was so rocky. I went on over</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the ridge and down to the creek bottom and found some grass and brush, etc.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I went back and took the cattle over, which gave them 2/3 of a feed. A</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">watchman stayed on the hill overnight. Next morning I went over with the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">rest to drive the cattle back and then I told them about there being quite</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a number of Indians camping along the creek. They thought I hadn&#39;t been</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">down there, but after a while they found the camps as I had told then.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then we drove on a half day and stopped to noon and a man by the name of</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dotworthy and myself went down on the ridges to see if we could find any-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thing to shoot. There we picked up a chunk which afterwards proved to be</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gold. We looked at.it awhile and then threw it down and left it. No doubt</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the piece was worth $1000.00.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we reached Bare River Hills, there we saw the first snow and straw-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">berry blossoms stick up to the edge of the snow. When we got down to Snake</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">River, we found plenty of Indians. I used to practice lifting with them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had one wagon that was pretty heavily loaded. I would turn my back to</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the wheel and take hold of the spokes and then motion for some of the big</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indians to come and lift it. But I never found but one that could lift it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then the Indians would point to me and say I was so much stronger than they</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were. When we came to Salmon Falls the Indians came to us every day and</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wanted to swap salmon for shirts. It didn&#39;t make any difference how ragged</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they were just so they could get them. Sometimes they would get a little</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sulky because we wouldn&#39;t trade with them. We traveled all the way down on</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the South side of Snake River and the first country we found that appeared</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to be muddy was along Powder River. When we started over Grand Round Valley,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought it the most beautiful country we had found yet. There I saw the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">largest bunch of Indian ponies I had ever seen. There were fully 2000 in</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the number.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we started up into the Blue Mountains there for the first time we came</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">into tall timber, and crossing Grand Round (Ronde) River you could see salmon</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">darting in every direction. After crossing the first mountain we found some</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">very rich land. When we crossed the first mountain before we crossed the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">river there was about a dozen Indians traveled with us for two weeks. I had</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a spring wagon with me, which the Indians had never seen before. Every night</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they would deposit a package of some kind in that wagon and would remove it</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">again every morning, and would talk about the wagon and appeared to be very</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">much pleased. They would camp at night and build a fire, and lay two tent</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">poles parallel on the ground; then they would form on each side and sit down</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with sticks in their hands and commence singing. The first Indian would have</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a stick sharpened to a point at each end, just long enough so he could hold</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it in his hands without it being seen. Then he would throw it from one hand</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to the other and the one that guessed which hand the stick was in got the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stick and repeated the same thing. This was their way of gambling. They</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">seemed very much delighted to think they could travel along with us. We</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">traveled over the Columbia River near the mouth of the Umatilla while they</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were with us.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was one man and his mother in the train, and one night we camped on</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Willow Creek. This man&#39;s name was Morgan and he was in the habit of picking</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">up ail the chains, picks, shovels, etc. he came across until his team was</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">completely broken down. We had to pull his wagon up all the hills, so that</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">night we appointed a committee, I being one of them, to inform him that he</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">must throw out some of those things or we would not help him any more. He</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">refused to do so. Then I told his mother to get into my wagon, and if I</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">reached my destination she would too. She said no, it would be too much</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">trouble. Then a Mr. Person spoke up and said she could ride in his wagon</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">part of the time. She refused the second offer so we had to proceed without</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By this time provisions were getting scarce and we had no time to waste. Im-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mediately after we left them we came to a mountain that took 14 yoke of oxen</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to pull up one wagon. The side of the mountain was full of Indians, some on</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">foot and some on horses, watching us get up the mountain. After we all got</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to the top we proceeded on our journey, and before night Morgan passed us</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">driving his oxen without the wagon. He had sent his mother and provisions</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and other things with Indians down to the mouth of the Deschutes River. When</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">we reached there a man by the name of Coile went down on the bank of the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">river and found the old lady in a little tent with the bedding and everything</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">else she had left was on the forward wheels of the wagon. He took her in his</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wagon and hauled her to The Dalles where she found her son.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Deschutes River was quite deep and when we crossed the Indians acted as</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">guides. We put a rope around the forward oxens&#39; horns, as the route was</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">somewhat crooked. After I crossed another team started and it got about</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">half way across and refused to go any farther. I got on my mule and took</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">my good yoke of leaders and drove in and hitched them on ahead and pulled</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them out. In that way we had quite a time getting the oxen turned around</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">in the water as it was very swift. The people in the wagon were so dizzy</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they could hardly sit in the seat. The Old Methodist National Bldg. was</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">still standing when we reached The Dalles. But there was no white people</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">except one Catholic priest amongst the Indians. There we left our wagons</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and hired Indians to take us to the Cascades in canoes.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We went on down the river and got a small flat boat and brought it to the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">foot of the Cascades, and packed everything on our backs to this boat, the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">distance being about 5 miles. We then went on down in the boat which leaked</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">so bad we had to keep three or four men bailing all the time to keep it from</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sinking.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the foot of Cape Horn Mts. is where the last bite of bread was eaten in</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the train. I had been providing provisions for part of the members in the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">train for nearly 300 miles. That night we came to where we could get plenty</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to eat again. The first house we came to after crossing the plains was at</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Washougal and the next one we came to was at Ft. Scott. The man&#39;s name was</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13">White </span><span class="c17">(4)</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we got to the Cascades we learned how the Indians made their beds. The</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">shore was very rocky so they would throw out the rocks from a place big</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">enough to lay in and make the sand level and that was their resting place.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before leaving The Dalles I hired an Indian at my own expense to drive the cat-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">tle down the trail as I had about 1/3 of the stock in the train. We crossed</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the cattle about 10 miles below the Cascades and next day we landed at Cas.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with stock.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">The next winter I went to work at a sawmill owned by a man named </span><span class="c13">Parker</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(5) about</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">mile and a half from where we landed. He paid me $5.00 per day and I agreed</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">to work that winter for him. A few days later I was offered work at </span><span class="c24 c13">another</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13">mill at Milwaukie</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(6) at $7.00 per day. But as I had promised to work that</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">winter, I stuck to my job. After we were at Parker&#39;s a few days a man and</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">myself took a skift (skiff?) and went to Vancouver for provisions. We got</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">plenty of flour and 30 pounds of pork from soldiers&rsquo; rations. A barrel of</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">thin syrup and a little butter so strong that it cured me from eating butter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We got the flour from the Hudson Bay Co. six miles above Vancouver. After</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">we left there a heavy wind came up and while we was crossing the river the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">water kept splashing in the boat, and the other man became frightened. He</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was pulling and I was steering and he quit, so I said, &quot;Pull, you devil,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pull, or we will go down}&quot; So he pulled like a good fellow till we reached</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the bank. Then we pulled on up near the bank till we got to Washougal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After we passed there a little ways the river became so swift that two In-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dians had to get in and help us out. One got on each side and pulled us</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">over the worst part. Then we proceeded to where we was going without any</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">help.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was only two men in the country that had any stock before we came there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One was Mr. Parker and the other an old Hudson Bay fellow that came to Van-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">couver in 1824. They had drove their cattle off into the rushes over Cape</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horn Mts., and immediately afterwards there came a two-foot snow. The river</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">froze over and we had nothing to live on, but that flour and syrup that winter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although I had five men boarding with me but they was glad to get what we did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We had bread and molasses for breakfast, and the reverse for dinner and supper.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">In the spring I moved in a little log house joining my </span><span class="c13">farm on Columbia Slough</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(7)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and soon after we all took the Mountain or Camp Fever, and also ran out of</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">provisions, yet we had good friends. The year before we moved there, there</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was a good crop of potatoes raised on the place, and that year there was a</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">few volunteer potatoes came up. Our friends, the </span><span class="c13">wood rats</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(8), would dig them</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">up and bring them in and pile them up in the log cabin and we would steal</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">them from the rats and make our soup of them. This was our living for some</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time. We had no doctor only from the Hudson Bay Co. and he charged $50.00</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">per trip besides his ferriage which brought his bill to $52.00. Between him</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and the wood rats we weathered it through.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My farm was then occupied by a man by the name of Webb. He wanted me to buy</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the place on account of him going to the mines at Snake River. He was almost</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a total stranger and wanted $1000.00 for the place and stock, which consisted</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of two yoke of oxen and 3 cows. I finally made a deal with him. I paid $300</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">down and gave him my note for $700 payable in 18 months. After the bargain</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was closed and the note given, he went out and dug up a good-sized bucket</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">full of money and wanted me to take care of it and also the note I had given</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him. I told him &quot;No,&quot; and he urged me so that finally I told him I would not</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">like to have anybody know it was about the house. He said I was the only one</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he would like to keep it and that no one would ever know from him that I had</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it. The money consisted of Mexican dollars and gold coins. The gold was in</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">$8.00 and $16.00 pieces called single loons and double loons. He said that</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">if he never came back I would be that much better off. I did not see him any</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">more for 18 months, although the mines he spoke of had never been discovered.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Soon after that Capt. Banburgan and Bradfords above the Cascades brought emi-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">gration down on a boat to the Cascades and took cattle for pay, and bought</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">also a large number of cattle and sent them down for me to sell, which gave</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">me something of a start. I also took jobs of work, times being good. The</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">old settlers had been to the mines and came back with quite a little money,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They being too good to work after making a fine start. The first summer I</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cleared $8.25 per day outside of my commissions on sales. Lumber at that</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time was worth $100.00 per thousand feet, and I went to work hauling lumber</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">from </span><span class="c13">Will&#39;s Mill</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(6) to the river. When I went to work on Monday, I would take</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a cedar saw log on my wagon and get it sawed and Saturday when I went home</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would buy a little more lumber. I was in need of a house very bad, so I</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">went to work and hewed out sills and studding, and cut white fir timber and</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">made clab boards and shaved them for siding. When I got it up and painted</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">very few people ever noticed the difference from sawed lumber. At that time</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it was the best locking house in the country. I spent a great deal of ny</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">time boring holes in burnt down trees and burning them up to clear a place</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to live on. After I had burnt off a great deal of timber in that way, I</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">took a notion to cut the timber in saw logs and bring it to Portland, which</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">consisted of about 15 or 20 buildings at that time. It was expressed along</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the river that I was a big fool for trying to get out saw logs when there</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">wasn&#39;t a boat on the river to tow with. But I had quite a number of oxen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought I could put the logs in the Slough and raft them as cheap as I</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">could burn them.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There came a high water the next summer, and I had got in about 300,000 ft.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and started them for Portland. We kept close around Gattens Point and went</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">out into the Willamette opposite Sauvies Island. Before starting I went to</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vancouver and got four old government tents, put up masts on the rafts and</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">stayed them with lines and stretched these tents up for sails. In a little</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">over four hours we landed in Portland. Soon after this there was quite a</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">number of other fools in the same business. Logging was carried on all</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">along the Slough. I then took a contract for quite a large number of logs,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the pay of which was to be part sawing and part money. When I got almost</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ready to start the logs to Portland, I received a word that the parties were</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">broke. So I came to Portland and went to </span><span class="c13">Mr. Mills the contractor</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(9) and told</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him I heard he was broke, and told him I could not make the contract on</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">those conditions. Then I went back and got my logs ready and brought them</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to Portland. So he offered to let me run the mill a month free. I told</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">him I would not start it for a month&#39;s run at all. He then wanted to sell</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">me the mill. I think I made about four bargains with him before he would</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">stand to it. I finally </span><span class="c13">bought the mill</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(10) to save myself on the logs, the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">raft being fully 3/4 of a mile long. I ran the mill a while, then </span><span class="c24 c13">sold out</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13">mill</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(10) and logs, there being $6,000 due me. They kept insisting for me to</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">wait longer and longer for the money, till </span><span class="c13">I waited six years</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(10) and had to</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">take my pay in greenbacks which were only worth 50&cent; on the dollar.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before there was any steamers here and also before this logging contract,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I took up a contract to bring up logs in the winter time. I think they</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">were to be at Portland some time in January. I was not much acquainted</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">with currents here and during this time there came a raise of about four</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">or five feet in the Willamette, and I first thought I was not going to be</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">able to get the logs to Portland. I came in and told the parties I didn&#39;t</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">think I could quite fulfill my promise on account of the raise in the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">river. So they said they would take them any time I could get them here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I went and bought a coil and a half of rope and spliced it together and</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pinned some logs together and made a windlass with a long sweep. I put</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that in a boat and would go up stream with it the length of the line.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I put two men on the sweep to make it fast, then go back and take turns at</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Captain, and one man to coil up the rope. We brought that up the river</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">against a pretty strong current, making about 3/4 of a mile a day, and</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">we reached Portland in 16 days.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">In 1857 I went into the </span><span class="c13">merchandise business</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(10A) in Portland and had about</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the largest retail store in town. After running it some time I became</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">too weakly to attend it, so had to put a man in charge by the name of</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13">Z. N. Stansbury</span><span class="c17">&nbsp;(11). He was </span><span class="c24 c13">elected County Treasurer and four of us went</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13">his bonds</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(11), and was the defaulter for $ 8,000.00. What I lost in the way</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of bonds and goods from the store through him made me the loser of about</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">$11,000.00. I was so bad with kidney complaint that I was not able to</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">be out of bed. There was an old doctor by the name of Millard in Port-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">land well known to the old settlers. He gave me four large doses of</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">calomel within about a week. The last dose commenced operating and I</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">felt my kidneys break loose and drop back about an inch and a half as</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">near as I could tell, and after that I felt like a new man.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next spring after this, I think it was in 1859, I fitted up a team </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">and went East of the mountains. I had made arrangements with </span><span class="c24 c13">Colonel</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13">Rubble</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(11A) &nbsp;to take me to The Dalles on his boat, and within about a week after</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the arrangements were made he sold out to the 0.R.&amp; N.Co., leaving me out</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">in the cold. I then chartered the </span><span class="c13">steamer Independence</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(12) and went to the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cascades on her. We camped there two weeks and then proceeded on up the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">river on a large scow that came down after us. I took a skift (skiff?)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and went up and met them and piloted from there down. Then the whole</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">company got very good and offered to take me to The Dalles on most any</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">terms. But I told them I had a conveyance to go up on so we loaded up</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and went ahead. We had a good breeze and went up quite rapidly. Some</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of the parties on the scow didn&#39;t understand the navigating of the scow</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">very well and was about to drift her into the rocks on the Washington</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">side. I said a man by the name of Vants to pick up a large 2-ft. plank</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that was on board and drop it over the side for a lay board to keep her</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">from going onto the rocks and then we soon brought her over to </span><span class="c13 c24">Crates</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13">Point</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(13). There we landed and took our stock and teams off. This was about</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">3 miles below The Dalles. Then we traveled at leisure, killing prairie.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">chickens and broiling them on the coals for our living. From Crates</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Point went on to Walla Walla by land, leaving two wagons at The Dalles</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and taking two with us. When we arrived at Walla Walla I sold my ox team.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">An Indian agent was there for the purpose of protecting the Indians.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Across the river was a tent where the white people sold liquor to the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indians. They got the Indians drunk and while they were in that dazed</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">condition they took about 150 or 200 ponies belonging to the Indians,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">and took them off down the valley and sold them. This is the way the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indians were &ldquo;protected&rdquo; there.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">&nbsp;After we got to Walla Walla there was going to be a </span><span class="c13">flour mill</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(13A) raised</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">which belonged to a man by the name of </span><span class="c13">Reynolds</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(13A). Captain Black and the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indian agent owned the ground for the millsite. So the Indian agent was</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">sent out to invite the men to the raising of the mill. They learned that</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was there so they told him not to come back without me, After he found</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">me and I promised to come he said they had a certain duty for me to pe -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">form. I asked him what it was and he said it was </span><span class="c24 c13">to keep Reynolds in a</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13">good humor</span><span class="c17">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">(13A). The men worked out in the hot sun where it was almost un-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bearable to be and Mr. Reynolds&rsquo; head got so hot that it kept him in a</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">bad humor. He used such abusive language that several of the men quit</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">work and left. So I got the rest of them in a cluster and told them not</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to get angry at whatever he might say. I soon discovered that he was</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">completely overcome with the heat. So I told him to tell me which way</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the timbers went and he did, so we soon had the mill up. Although we had</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">no sawed timbers to put in, all being hewed, even the braces and studding,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it twisted around so in the hot sun that it&rsquo; was hard to get together, but</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">finally it came out all right.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that we visited Whitman&#39;s Station, expecting to find the handsomest</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">place in the valley. Although a pretty fair place, the site selected for</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">it was between two hills that came near together right in the Indians&rsquo; pass</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c1">way. There was two small pair of millstones dressed out of the rock found</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">there to put up a small mill where the Indians could get their corn ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">Then we returned to Portland and I bought a </span><span class="c13">sawmill at Vancouver</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(14), and ex-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pected to get the government trade. I kept it for a while but as I charged</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">them the same as I did everybody else I lost their trade. I built a </span><span class="c24 c13">grist</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13">mill to it</span><span class="c17">&nbsp;(15), and it afterwards </span><span class="c13">burnt</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(15) without any insurance. I then built</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">a </span><span class="c13">grist and sawmill where the Hudson Bay Co. had theirs</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(16). After running</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that quite a while (16A), it became flooded with high water and several of us</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">took the notion to go to boating.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We had a meeting. Myself, Farnsworth and J. D. Biles were elected direct-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">ors. It was almost all thrown onto my shoulders. So I went out to </span><span class="c24 c13">Salmon</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13">Creek and rented a mill</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(17). I took some men out to dig up the trees with long</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">roots on one side for the bottom timbers of the boat. I would go out one</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">morning and saw till the next evening and bring a load in with me. Farns-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">worth was a good builder and he wanted to build the boat. Then I had to</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">take charge of the planking under his directions. The O.R.&amp;N. Co. made fun</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of us, they having two large boats brought here from the East. I made a</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">contract to have the machinery made in Portland. We sent to California for</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the silders and a few other things, and they were sent up to be finished</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">here. The boiler was too light and before we got through it broke up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then I hired a young man by the day whose name was Dehuff, to finish up the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">machinery. I got the shop for him to work in, and when it was finished we</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">started to put it in the boat.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">About that time there was an organization of the Peoples&#39; Transportation</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Co. and we gave them the job of raising the machinery. When it was com-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">pleted we had the fastest boat on the river. Her name was the </span><span class="c13">E. D. BAKER</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(18).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then I commenced getting out timbers for another boat above the Cascades (18A).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hauled the timber to my own mill and sawed it and sent it above the Cas-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cades. We finished that boat and called her the IRIS. We also had an-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">other boat above Deschutes River. At last a dispute arose between the two</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">companies, to see which would have the route on the Columbia. We commenced</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">cutting rates, till we carried passengers from Portland to The Dalles for</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">50&cent;. Both companies run in debt until Mr. Ladd made a proposition to com-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">promise. We gave them two steamboats and freight boats on the Columbia,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">keeping the E.D. BAKER, and they gave us 7 steamboats and freight boats on</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the Willamette and $10,000 in cash for us to get off of the Columbia and</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">they got off of the Willamette.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">Then we went to work and put in a </span><span class="c13">breakwater at Oregon City</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(19) 1&frac12; &nbsp;mi. in</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">length and built a </span><span class="c13">basin at the falls </span><span class="c17">to run into. Then we built a </span><span class="c24 c13">shoot</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13">to get the freight down to the boats</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;below. I stayed in that business</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">several years and sold out. After I sold out, stock commenced running down</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">till it got to about 30&cent; on the dollar, and then a man by the name of Holla-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">day bought out the whole thing,</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I then came to Portland and went into the furniture business. I built me a</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">large store (18B) and had it all quite nicely furnished and the big fire of 1873</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">burnt it up and nearly everything in it, without any insurance. Then I had</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">to recruit a few years before I could do much more. A few years after that</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">I put up some </span><span class="c13">brick buildings </span><span class="c17">(20) and also some </span><span class="c13">wooden ones</span><span class="c1">, which I have yet</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">except what I have given to the heirs.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The year of 1899, Nov. 29, about four months ago, I commenced to build a</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13">new residence</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(21), and expect to put quite a few men to work making more im-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">provements in a few days. I have been sought after for some time </span><span class="c24 c13">forging</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13">wills and deeds</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(22) for a large amount of my property.

The</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">first meeting of the County Commissioners of Multnomah County was on Jan. 17, 1855.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On April 4, 1855 petition was presented regarding rate of ferriage.

It also is</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ordered that he pay a license fee of $5.00 per year. It would certainly seem that if</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a man paid $2.00 to have himself and team ferried across the Columbia by John Switzler and 25&cent; additional to be ferried across the Columbia Slough by Lewis Love, he was paying plenty; but on July 3, 1855, at the first meeting of the new board of County Commissioners, consisting of Samel Farman, Ellis Walker and Dana Powell, application was made by Lewis Love to have a new schedule of charges allowed. The old record of this action reads: &ldquo;Relative to the application of Lewis Love to run a ferry on the road from Portland to Switzler&#39;s on the Columbia, across the Slough at his place, it was ordered that the following rates be established for the ensuing year: Foot passengers 12&frac12; &cent;; horse and mule 12&frac12; &cent;; man on horse 25&cent;; wagon and one horse 37&frac12; &cent;; wagon with two horses 50&cent;.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Excerpt from Oregonian 4/26/1897: &quot;It was he (Capt.

I decided to try rafting to Portland. I put about 20,000 logs in the stream during high water in the Winter of 1852. I then built upright posts and yards on one end of the raft and sailed to Portland. A good strong breeze carried us up the river. We made the trip in about four hours. Another time I came near being caught in a pinch on a contract to deliver logs to the mills in Portland. The water dropped down and a strong current was running in the river. We had to work our way up from the head of the Sauvies Island Slough by an improvised capstan, or windlass, the end of the rope being attached to any convenient object along the shore while the windlass was worked taking up the coil of rope. If I remember rightly we were 16 days getting to the city.</span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Multnomah County did not exist until December 22, 1854.

In 1851 Lewis Love obtained a licence from Clackamas County to operate a ferry across Columbia Slough, on the road towards the ferry across the Columbia River operated by John Switzler (Query, 2008, p. 54).

One error, for example, is that the tree says William Ulysses Love, the oldest son, was born in October 1838 and Jeremiah Joye, the second son, in December 1838. This seems unlikely. Like the rest of this book, the tree is a work in progress. As new information becomes available, it is added. I did limit myself, for obvious reasons, to including children and grandchildren, with their partners. No great-grandchildren, with the exception of Hazel Viola King, because she appears in the will of Lewis Love. Partners of the Love sons and daughters often had previous marriages, and children from those previous marriages. And these children were usually adopted into their new Love families.

This shows where the family lived, which children lived at home, and what the current occupations were. We start in 1840, while the Love family resided in DeKalb, Illinois. The census form is somewhat unclear, and ancestry.com has it under the name Towers Jone, but after deciphering it we see two free white male persons younger than five (sons William and Jeremiah), one free white male person between 20 and 30 (Lewis) and one free white female person between 20 and 30 (Nancy). Of these one person is in the category &ldquo;</span><span class="c17">working in agriculture</span><span>&rdquo; and one in &ldquo;</span><span class="c17">insane and idiots in public charge</span><span class="c6">&rdquo;.

William (married in 1854), Malinda (married in 1856) and Mary (married in 1856) had already moved out. </span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c16"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LUdsRd1OIaaGQv_WTJAepLopJy5i5b4v&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1630355150379000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3p36MU6caLQQ3ZK6QAQWog">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LUdsRd1OIaaGQv_WTJAepLopJy5i5b4v</a></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c16"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L_J1XGgqmLVaoEaZR287QQDitVB6s1KB&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1630355150379000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1K1gBp3a5fP5B2hNf_IrwG">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L_J1XGgqmLVaoEaZR287QQDitVB6s1KB</a></span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">In 1870 Lewis was a sawyer in a saw mill, still living in Clark County.

It has a useful list of the real property owned and it lists all the heirs. It shows how careful Lewis Love was to make sure this document was known to be his real and only will. As the end of the Manuscript indicates, he had to deal with forged wills and with challenges of his wife&rsquo;s will after she died. The will also indicates that in all the years he never sold any real estate, he only bought more. The parcels in sections 10, 11, 14, and 16 were 640 acres at the time of the donation land claim, and they were 757 acres at the time of the testament, mostly by extending the original DLC to the west and to the north over the Slough, by buying parts of the Switzler DLC up to Force&rsquo;s Lake.</span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>Remember that Lewis Love died in 1903.

T. Struble, Philo Holbrook and H. C. Breeden executors of this my last will and testament, and request and direct that no bonds or undertaking be required of them as such, nor of them as trustees to hold my estate to a certain time hereinafter mentioned. I direct that all of my just debts, including funeral expenses and the expenses of administration, be paid by my executors. I order that my purpose and ownership of property shall be clearly understood, I hereby preface my devises and requests as follows: I have made no deed to any person or persons to any real or personal property to take effect at or after my death. I made five deeds to my children and grandchildren September 21, 1894, which were executed and acknowledged before T. T. Struble, notary public. I made eights deeds to my children, grandchildren and grandchild December 28, 1896, which were also acknowledged before T. T. Struble, notary public, other than these mentioned deeds I have made none since the first mentioned ones of September 21, 1894. I am the owner absolute of the following real property in the city of Portland, Oregon: Lots 1 and 2, block 177, city; lot 4, block 116, city; lot 3, block 10, city; north half lot 2, block 10, city; lot 8, block 11, city; south half of lot 2, block 4, city; the est 75 feet and 11 inches of the south half of lot 4, block 3, city; the north half of lot 4, block 3, city; the south half of lot 3, block 3, city. I have never made a deed to any person or persons of any part or piece of this property whatever. I also own 757 acres, more or less, of land in sections 10, 11, 14, and 15, township 1 north, range 1 east, Willamette meridian; a portion of this land is outside of and a portion inside the city limits of Portland, Oregon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I have made no deed to any of this acreage to any person or persons at any time, except for Columbia Cemetery. It is my purpose to will at this time all of my property, personal, real and mixed, to my legal heirs in the same proportion as the law would convey the same to them in the absence of any will by me, reserving only the burial place where my wife is now buried, and a strip of land two feet in width adjacent thereto on the west, north and east of said burial spot, and I hereby set aside said burial place (spot) and said two feet of land adjacent thereto forever as a resting place or burial spot for my wife and myself; said burial place joins Columbia Cemetery on the northwest corner, which said cemetery is in section 10, township 1 north, range 1 east, Willamette meridian.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My will is and I direct that my estate shall be divided into six (6) shares or parts of equal value, to be disposed of in the following manner, viz: First. I give, devise and bequeath to my son, Fred D. Love, one of said shares or parts. Second. I give, devise and bequeath to my son, Green C. Love, one of said shares or parts. Third. I give, devise and bequeath to my son, Lewis P. Love, one of said shares or parts. Fourth. I give, devise and bequeath to my grandson, William King, a son of my deceased daughter Malinda J. Sheperd, one-third part of one of said shares or parts. Fifth. I give, devise and bequeath to my granddaughter, Matilda Sheperd, wife of James Shepard, and a daughter of my deceased daughter Malinda J. Sheperd, one-third part of one of said shares or parts. &nbsp;Sixth. I give, devise and bequeath to my great-granddaughter, Hazel King, who is a minor child, and a daughter of Albion King, deceased, who is a son of my deceased daughter Malinda J. Sheperd, one-third part of one of said shares or parts. Seventh. I give, devise and bequeath to my daughter, Mary C. Stafford, one of said shares or parts. Eighth. I give, devise and bequeath to the children of my deceased son, William Love, one of said shares or parts of my estate to be divided among said children as follows: To L.W. Love, the one-fifth part of said share; to John A. Love, the one-fifth part of said share; to Ulysses G. Love, the one-fifth part of said share; to Charles W.

I direct that my executors shall proceed to administer upon my estate at once after my demise, and having in due time closed up my estate as executors, that then my estate shall pass to them as trustees, to be held in trust for my said devisees till January 1, 1907, and managed by them as such trustees until the time of final distribution. I direct that my trustees, T. T. Struble, Philo Holbrook and H. C. Breeden, from time to time as the receipts of my estate may exceed the expenditures, such portion thereof as in the judgment of my said trustees can safely be distributed and paid to the devisees pro rata, not oftener than two times in each twelve months. I direct that my trustees make final distribution of my estate on January 1, 1907, or as soon thereafter as practicable, and if my devisees can agree, said final distribution can be by division of my property by such agreement, but if they cannot so agree, the my trustees shall make a division of my property according to the shares and parts of shares in my estate and my devisees can cast lots for their several interests either in person or by their lawful representatives. Be it remembered, however, that in the administration of my estate by my executors, and before they close up my estate, and it passes to them as trustees, all personal property is to be sold, and the proceeds of such sale will belong to and become a part of my estate.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In their trust my trustees are hereby empowered to rent property and collect rents, make necessary repairs to property, pay taxes, or to be more explicit, they are empowered hereby to collectively do all acts that I could do were I living, necessary tp protect and keep my estate intact for my devisees hereinbefore mentioned. Should a vacancy occur in my trustees, then the remaining ones or one are to act and carry out this trust. This is my only will, but I now refer to a canceled will made by me April 13, 1896, for the purpose of corroborating the idea that it was always my purpose to distribute my property equally between my several children and to the heirs of those of my children who had died, leaving children or grandchildren.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Be it remembered that reference to said canceled will shall not make it a part of this will, but only show what my intentions have always been toward my heirs. Reference to the fact in this will that I am the owner of and have made no deed to certain property, is because I have been informed, reliably, of one fraudulent deed to certain valuable property purporting to have been made by me and also have heard rumours of the existence of another fraudulent deed. I pronounce and declare alls such deeds or deed as fraudulent; and any and all claims of any person or persons of having genuine deeds or titles to any of the property hereinbefore described, are false and villainous, and I hereby instruct my executors and trustees to context any such claims to the uttermost, that my property may be kept intact and saved to my lawful heirs as herein devised. And lastly, I do hereby revoke all other wills heretofore made by me, and declare this and no other to be my last will and testament, and desire that of this proof shall be taken and admitted to probate as a muniment of title.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 5th day of January, 1899. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">[Signed] Lewis Love [Seal]</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">So a short summary of the distribution of the estate is:</span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">&#8537; to Fred D.

I hereby expressly confirm my last will, dated January 5, 1899, excepting in so far as the distribution of my property is changed by this codicil. First. I hereby will, decree and declare that the devise or legacy to my daughter, Mary C. Stafford in my said will, shall be for her sole and separate use, independent of her husband at all times, and that at her death the said devise or legacy to her shall go to her children, share and share alike. Second. I hereby will, decree and declare that the devise or legacy, in my said will, to my son, Fred D. Love, shall be for his sole and separate use, independent of his wife at all times, and that at his death the said devise or legacy to him shall go to his children, share and share alike. Third. Second. I hereby will, decree and declare that the devise or legacy in my said will to my son, Green C. Love shall be for his sole and separate use, independent of his wife at all times, and that in case of his death without lawful issue, born alive and living at the time of his death, then the said devise or legacy to him shall belong and go to the remaining devisees of my said will in proportion as they hold of the shares or parts of my said will. Lastly. I declare this is a codicil to my will, and that this is the only codicil that I have made, and I hereby declare my said will of date January 5, 1899, to be my last will and testament and also hereby re-affirm the same in every particular, except a modified by this codicil, which codicil is to be attached to the sad will. Witness my hand and sea this 26th day of February, 1902. [Signed] Lewis Love. [Seal.]</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>The codicil does two things. It protects the estate against the scheming husbands and wives of Mary, Fred, and Green and makes sure the property only travels in a straight genealogical line, without reverting to inlaws and other deplorables. In the second place it singles out Green C. Love, who was married in 1876 and had five children. In 1896, however, both his wife and all his children had died. He remarried in 1901 with a bride he had found through a personal ad, which was a method and a resulting bride the Captain did not approve of. So again the special provision had be added to the codicil to make sure the property did not go to outsiders. As we shall see this codicil resulted in lawsuits and court proceedings that lasted more than ten years. More about this later in this chapter.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><h2 class="c21" id="h.jelqzb7gjvay"><span class="c27">Nancy M.

The manuscript of Captain Lewis Love says that three of his sons drowned, but it only mentions William by name as one of them. So I assume that both Jeremiah and Joseph drowned.

I do not know where he got the more than one thousand dollars to pay for it, but let&rsquo;s review the parcel we are talking about.</span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">On March 10, 1866 the United States registered a military warrant for 160 acres to Charles Vincent, for his service in Private Company H, 2nd Regiment of U.S. Dragoons, in some so-called Apache Indian Disturbance. Charles Vincent immediately transferred the land to Robert S. Maxey. Here is the patent.</span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c16"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/open?id%3D1OUOOb58IKpdXVW8GebZXacBx45Y_f0dw&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1630355150407000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0oBwBMNT2BSy8El9YkRtyO">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OUOOb58IKpdXVW8GebZXacBx45Y_f0dw</a></span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">The precise description of the land is</span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fractional South East quarter of Section Nine and the Fractional South West quarter of Section Ten in Township One North of Range One East in the District of lands subject to sale at Oregon City, Oregon, containing one hundred and Fifty two acres and one hundredth of an acre.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">In terms of modern streets, the land is bounded by Kilpatrick to the north, Lombard to the south, the I-5 to the east, and (approximately) Delaware to the west. In other words, a large chunk of current Kenton. On December 28, 1860 Robert S. Maxey sold the 152.01 acres to William Love for one thousand and twenty five dollars.</span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c16"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/open?id%3D1d0DwA318z6u_lHuJCiMru_CyE84ScvE-&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1630355150409000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2u1pV8uZRcjrqawO7YUNWl">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1d0DwA318z6u_lHuJCiMru_CyE84ScvE-</a></span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">The dates on the deed are interesting. The Military Donation act was passed in 1855, and presumably Charles Vincent claimed his donation shortly after that. Then Robert Maxey sold to William Love in 1860, even though the official warrant was not issued until 1866. If we go over the various homesteads and donation land grants mentioned in this book we see that many of the warrants and patents were not registered until 1866. This delay is not unusual, as Vaughan (2014, p. 45) explains.</span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The GLO district land offices were required to certify entitlement to a land patent by issuance of a final certificate upon satisfaction of all statutory requirements by the entryman or purchaser.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">And the year 1866 is of special significance. Again from Vaughan (2014, p. 45)</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">The issuance of land patents was greatly curtailed during the turbulent Civil War years of 1861 to 1865 &ndash; delaying most donation land claim patents until after the war.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">In the case of the Maxey-Love transaction there was even more delay. The deed was signed in 1860 in the County of Clark, Territory of Washington, in the presence of William Kelly, Clerk of the District Court. Mr. Kelly basically notarized the signing of the deed, using an oath by a Mr. John Hexler that the person who appeared before him was indeed Robert Maxey. This may not have been enough to actually file the deed with Multnomah County, and in 1877 Roger Greene, associate justice of the Washington Supreme Court, testified that William Kelly was indeed a clerk at that time, and that the laws of Washington authorized him to notarize the deed. In addition, in 1882, a Mr. McConnell, the current clerk and &nbsp;record keeper for the district court, testified that William Kelly was who he said he was, and that his signature was indeed his true signature. So this was 22 years after the original signing. Moreover, as we shall see, it was three years after the death of William Love.</span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>Over the years, William Love became a thriving &nbsp;and well-respected citizen. In the 1870 census the family lived in the Willamette Precinct with six children and two laborers. In 1875 William was appointed Supervisor of Multnomah County road district 3. In 1876 he was appointed Judge of Elections in the Willamette District. He also served on the school board for the district. But all was not well. Below are two articles from the Morning Oregonian, the first from February 12, 1879 and the second from the next day, and one from the Willamette Farmer of February 14. William Love committed suicide by drowning himself in the Columbia Slough. &ldquo;... he had rid himself of his bodily ills by casting himself into the river.&rdquo;</span><span class="c17">&nbsp;</span><span>There is obviously no clear diagnosis of his ailment in these articles from 1879, but the officiating clergyman mentioned that &ldquo;a protracted illness of nearly two years, accompanied by occasional paroxysms of internal distress, had so far unbalanced his mind as to constitute him periodically insane.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 242.50px; height: 395.21px;"><img alt="" src="images/image22.png" style="width: 242.50px; height: 395.21px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 295.50px; height: 389.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.png" style="width: 295.50px; height: 389.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 223.50px; height: 365.01px;"><img alt="" src="images/image42.png" style="width: 223.50px; height: 365.01px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">William died on February 11, 1879. One week later, on February 17, his father Lewis Love was appointed as administrator of the estate.

Ulery et al valued the land at $ 2,500. Lewis Love asked permission of the court to sell the land by auction in three pieces: the western half, the western half of the eastern half, and the eastern half of the eastern half. And this is exactly what happened. On February 11, 1882 the western half was sold to William Showers, sheriff of Multnomah County, for $ 1,634.10. At the same auction the western half of the eastern half was sold to Charles Sitton for $ 798.04. It seems that something was wrong with the Showers transaction. On May 15, 1882 there was a second auction, where Joseph Buchtel, sheriff of Multnomah County, bought the western half for $ 3,192.20. The eastern half of the eastern half, which was the part where William Love had his house and business, and the part adjoining the Lewis Love DLC, was not sold, at least not yet.</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 260.50px; height: 399.17px;"><img alt="" src="images/image26.png" style="width: 260.50px; height: 399.17px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 268.13px; height: 404.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image10.png" style="width: 268.13px; height: 404.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Here is the final account of the administrator. We see the land sales, totalling $ 3,192.20 + $ 798.04 = $ 3,990.24. There are other items on the &ldquo;money received&rdquo; side that are &nbsp;interesting. There were 670 cords of wood, appraised at $ 700. There were 500 bushels of potatoes, appraised at 60 cents a bushel. They had to be sold rather quickly, otherwise they would sprout. There were six adult cows, appraised at $ 25 per cow, 3 two-year old cows at $ 15, and 3 one-year old cows at $ 7.50. On the &ldquo;money paid&rdquo; side we see more than $ 250 paid to neighbor John Hotts, who plays a role in many of the chapters of this book. The $ 408 paid to Antoine Masley was the balance for &ldquo;work and labor&rdquo; performed at the request of William Love during the years 1875-1879, at a salary of $ 30 per month. We also see $ 643.98 paid to the Oregon and Washington Trust and Investment Company. This is for a mortgage of originally $ 600 on his land that William Love got in 1877. The biannual payments were about $ 77, and these payments were three years in arrears in 1882. The balance of the account was distributed to Sarah Love and her six sons (or to their guardians, if they were still minors in 1882). Each of them got $ 371.53.

She was born in Missouri in 1841. I know very little about her, presumably because her career was &ldquo;keeping house&rdquo;. She married three times, the first time in 1856, when she was 15. Her first husband was John P. King, a farmer and general utility man located in Benton County, in the Corvallis area. He was born in 1835 in Iowa and came to Oregon in 1853. His OHS archive card tells us he was a socialist. Good for him. In the 1860 census the couple lived in Corvallis, and they had a one year old son Theodore. In 1870 Malinda lived with Theodore and eight year old Albion and three year old William in Clark County, Territory of Washington. Both Albion and William were born in Washington, but there is no John P. King on the census form any more. In 1880 we do find John P.

Love and Nathan Stafford</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Mary C. Love was born in Missouri on April 25, 1842. She crossed the plains with her parents and arrived in Multnomah in 1849. On September 14, 1856, when she was 14 years old, she married George W. Shafer (or Schaeffer), who was 30 years old at the time, and in the grocery store business with her father. George Shaeffer died the next year, and Mary married Nathan D. Stafford in 1859, when he was 33 years old and she was 17, and already two years a widow. O tempora ! O mores !</span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">From then on, we can follow Mary through the successive federal censuses and city directories and see what the composition of her household is. Around 1880 she is listed as a nurse or midwife, while Nathan is a carpenter. In 1860 Mary has given birth to a daughter Emeline, at the census date 7 months old. In 1870 Emeline is 8, and she are joined by Leona (6), Matilda (4), and Ulysses Grant (1). In 1880 we find Ida (13), Louis G. (11), Nancy M. (9), Sarah R. (7), Delia (5), Lena (3), and Geo (2 months). There is no 1890 census, and in 1900 there are no new children, and we have Lena (22), Lewis (31), and Nellie C (34) living at home. Nathan Stafford died in 1903.</span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">In the 1910 census Mary has moved in with her daughter Alice (then Alice L. Preacher) and in 1920 she lives with her other daughter Nancy (then Nancy M. Finke). She dies August 14, 1927 at 360 E. Lombard Street (now 65 NE Lombard), 85 years old. From the eulogies it seems that the surviving children are Emma J. Walker, Alsistres L. Peacher, Lewis G. Stafford, Nancy M. Finke, &nbsp;Sedelia P. Hohmann, all of Portland, Oregon, Sarah R. Anderson of Orchards, Washington, and Lena G. Richmond of Ardenwald, Oregon. Note that Emma is Emeline, the oldest daughter, born in 1860.</span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 322.62px; height: 513.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.png" style="width: 322.62px; height: 513.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">I have some special feelings for Mary and Nathan, because I live on Stafford Street. Snyder (1979, p 208) says</span></p><p class="c5 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The original dedication of this street was in the University Park neighborhood. If, as we believe, the name was chosen by the Methodists who developed University Park, it is probably a namesake for Charles Lewis Stafford, who was president of Iowa Wesleyan University 1891-1899. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Nice try, but no cigar. There seems to have been a Stafford Street in South Saint John&rsquo;s, which was renamed out of existence around 1908. There is a small section of &nbsp;Stafford Street on the border of University Park, between Woolsey and Olin, at the south line of Mock&rsquo;s Addition, but it was originally called Syracuse Street, and it was renamed to Stafford Street in 1918. I do not see a Stafford Street in the original 1891 plat maps for University Park. There is one in the original plats for Loveleigh, Lovewood, and Swinton from around 1908. And then around 1910-1920 there was some additional renaming and Stafford Street came to run east from Union through Farrell&rsquo;s Addition and Farrell&rsquo;s Second Addition until it ran into Lombard and stopped.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>. </span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><h3 class="c10" id="h.at48lcvj5kj6"><span class="c18">Frederick D.

The reason is probably that there were two different versions of Nancy&rsquo;s wills circulating. I will discuss this in great detail in the section on the fake will in this chapter, but for now it suffices to know that in one of the wills Nancy left $ 100 to each of her sons and daughters, and the rest of the estate to Lewis Love while in the other will she left $ 100 to Lewis Love and the rest of the estate to her sons and daughters. And remember that it was the Lewis and Nancy Love Donation Land Claim, which means that legally she was the owner of 320 acres. And development had started in the area, with Good Morning Addition, Piedmont, Woodlawn, Saratoga, Lochinvar all having been platted in 1892. Captain Lewis Love was an old hand at lawsuits, and he did not take kindly to the fact that Fred Love sued him in trying to throw out the first will, favorable to Lewis, and replace it by the second will, favorable to the offspring, and thus to Fred. It seems Lewis did not take half measures, and he had Fred arrested for insanity in November 1892.
