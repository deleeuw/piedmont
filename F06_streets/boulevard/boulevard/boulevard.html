Geographically it makes most sense to define the Peninsula as the area between the Willamette River and the Columbia River, west of what is now I-5, or maybe west of what is now Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. It is also tempting to identify it with the modern North Portland Neighborhood Coalition, which consists of the eleven neighborhoods west of Interstate 5, plus Piedmont, East Columbia, and Hayden Island. Or with what the City considers to be North Portland, which is basically everything between the rivers west of Williams Avenue. In the old newspapers the Peninsula, or Willamette-Columbia Peninsula, &nbsp;was defined loosely, &nbsp;and even included Woodlawn sometimes. The term does not really seem to be used much before 1890. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">So what was there on the Peninsula at the end of the nineteenth century ? The oldest part was its most western area. Pieces of the Town of St. Johns were platted between 1865 and 1876. The City of St. Johns was incorporated and got its charter in 1902. The City of Albina incorporated in 1887, and In 1891 annexed all of the Peninsula, except St. Johns. As we shall try to show, one reason for the annexation is that some business interests started to make plans for the Peninsula. In the Oregonian of August 20, 1888 we see the first signs of this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 336.50px; height: 220.38px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 336.50px; height: 220.38px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/open?id%3D1Af1XXZxior0EkcBKJOFZfOjwGiM6PpKT&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1630364499994000&amp;usg=AOvVaw15ey1JBugEAQVfv_JDF3er">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Af1XXZxior0EkcBKJOFZfOjwGiM6PpKT</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">There is another clear sign. In July of that same year 1891 Portland, East Portland, and Albina were consolidated into a new city, also known as the City of Portland. &nbsp;The major reason for Albina and East Portland to vote for consolidation was that the larger city could more efficiently deliver the services needed for development. The excellent 1915 map at the beginning of this chapter illustrates the various annexations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">As a consequence of this annexation, and the planning of large private investments (or, more precisely, relatively small investments with a potentially large payoff) around 1890 development on the more eastern parts of the Peninsula really started to take off. We see tireless boosting by Francis McKenna, John Mock, Edward Quackenbush, William Killingsworth, and their various real estate companies and business associations. Undeveloped land was made ready for development. Piedmont, Saratoga and Lochinvar were platted in 1889, Portsmouth and Goodmorning in 1890, University Park and Arbor Lodge in 1891. Peninsula Additions numbers one to five were added between 1890 and 1892. The newspaper of record started to show the usual signs that some people were spending substantial amounts of advertising dollars to boost their investments. In the Oregonian of May 11, 1890 we see a tantalizing announcement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 565.00px; height: 151.92px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 565.00px; height: 151.92px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/open?id%3D1Z-XFGRMwGUsATOYPHhXKOLAyAhNZdZcO&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1630364499995000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3A4oxTJY5SYwmMSFBSUBZA">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Z-XFGRMwGUsATOYPHhXKOLAyAhNZdZcO</a></span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8 c12"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">The map included in this announcement is interesting.

We see the many houses in Albina and the promising emptiness on the peninsula.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Famous persons were recruited to sing the praises of the Peninsula. Perhaps the most famous person in Oregon at the time was Henry Vilard, founder and/or owner of the Northern Pacific Railroad, the New York Post, The Nation, and General Electric, major donor to the University of Oregon, father of Union Station, the Portland Hotel, and the railroad line through the Columbia Gorge. In the Oregonian of May 22, 1890 we read his poetic view of the Willamette-Columbia peninsula.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5 c1"><span class="c7">It will contain some day the business and population of a large city. Look at the miles of waterfront navigable to the deepest sea-going vessels. That neck of land will be surrounded with docks and wharves where the vessels of the world will exchange cargoes. The busy hum of factories will be heard there from morning till night and from night till morning. Great banking firms will be established there to accommodate this business.

It promises, by citing an &ldquo;Eastern gentleman of large and varied experience&rdquo;, that &ldquo;acres selling to-day for a few hundred dollars will in the course of very few years bring as many thousands&rdquo;.

He also platted Good Morning Addition and Lochinvar, and was the sole agent selling lots in Portsmouth and Arbor Lodge. </span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span>It was clearly in McKenna&rsquo;s interest to &ldquo;unlock the Peninsula&rdquo; by having electric streetcar lines and a system of paved and wide streets (boulevards) going all the way to St. Johns.

There is Willamette Boulevard along the Willamette River, Columbia Boulevard along the Columbia Slough, and Portland Boulevard through the middle of the Peninsula. All three boulevards started basically at Vancouver Boulevard and continued all the way to St. Johns. Note that in the advertisements &nbsp;Willamette and Portland Boulevards are drawn in as if they already existed, and were already graded and paved. That was not the case at all, as we will see below. In fact, Portland Boulevard (now Rosa Parks Way) was never extended that far west, and was replaced in the boulevard scheme by Lombard Street (only a &ldquo;street&rdquo;, not a &ldquo;boulevard&rdquo;).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c8"><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 313.44px; height: 433.23px;"><img alt="" src="images/image10.png" style="width: 313.44px; height: 433.23px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Also note, as an aside, that the Portsmouth advertisement really makes it attractive to buy three lots. It even comes with a quaint type of mortgage insurance</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5 c1"><span class="c7">In case of death of purchaser, before completing payment for lots, we will give warranty deeds to heirs of deceased clear of encumbrance for the three lots without further payment.

The following note from the St. Johns Review of August 17, 1906 illustrates the sales pitch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c8 c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 297.50px; height: 333.53px;"><img alt="" src="images/image15.png" style="width: 297.50px; height: 333.53px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c8 c1 c12"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>Through the years, all the way into the twenty first century, Portland city government has very much agreed that &ldquo;steady growth pays best in the long run&rdquo;. I am not so sure they had the same positive opinion about the value and effectiveness of &ldquo;good morals&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">It is important to emphasize again that the plan for the boulevard system was born in the City of Albina. This is shown clearly in the map on the Arbor Lodge advertisement. &nbsp;At that time talk of consolidation with Portland was very much in the air. The Oregonian published letters on May 14 and May 20, 1891 signed by a person or persons using the pseudonym &ldquo;Albina&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">The main argument made by &ldquo;Albina&rdquo; in those letters (you can find links in the references section at the end of this chapter) was that the anti-consolidationists conspired with both city and state government to postpone consolidation for a couple of years until they had secured the $ 50,000 in bond money and $ 50,000 in parks money that the city council of Albina had allocated. Transferring the bond, and the plans for boulevards and parks on the Peninsula, to a consolidated Portland introduced an element of uncertainty. Although &ldquo;Albina&rdquo; never mentions McKenna by name, it is clear that he is the main villain in this conspiracy. The boulevards, railways, and parks were greatly increasing the value of his property, and that of the other real estate men involved in the conspiracy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5 c1"><span class="c7">Last year a certain dealer in real estate down on the peninsula, who, by the way, is not a resident of Albina, succeeded in working up a boulevard scheme in connection with other owners of property through or along which the proposed boulevard would pass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Now I must admit that my personal biases make it easy for me to believe that real estate dealers and developers conspire with local government to get their projects approved and their plans passed. This does not imply that their projects are necessarily detrimental to the common good, but it does imply that undue influence is used to make some people richer than others, and that tax dollars are used to heavily subsidize growth of private fortunes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">There was a furious reaction to &ldquo;Albina&rdquo; by McKenna on May 24, 1891. Again, see the link in the references section. His letter includes a short history of the boulevard system proposal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5 c1"><span class="c7">About two years ago a large number of property owners on the peninsula and in Albina concluded something must be done to attract the attention of the people to Albina&rsquo;s natural advantages or &ldquo;the city would grow south&rdquo; and Albina would be left the same old &ldquo;mud hole&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">The &ldquo;public-spirited men&rdquo; decided to establish the Willamette-Columbia Peninsula Advertising Committee, buying $ 4,000 worth of advertising to promote Albina. The committee agreed for McKenna to advocate in the Oregonian for &ldquo;a grand system of boulevards connecting Albina, Portland, East Portland, St. Johns, and Mount Tabor.&rdquo; Subsequently a right-of-way committee</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">(chaired by Killingsworth) and a finance committee (chaired by McKenna) were appointed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5 c1"><span class="c7">At this time I did not own one dollar&rsquo;s worth of property on the proposed line of boulevard and neither did the people I represent.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">And we are supposed to believe that ? Several miles of right-of-way were obtained, presumably for Willamette Boulevard, and negotiations with the state senate and the Albina city council resulted in the actual allocation of $ 50,000 for boulevards and $ 50,000 for parks. At consolidation, of course, the newly formed City of Portland took over the encumbrances of the bonds. McKenna tells the story how the boulevard scheme fared in state and city government, all in 1891, and ends his letter with a Trumpian flourish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5 c1"><span class="c7">Mr. &ldquo;Albina&rdquo; if you believe what you say, it is your duty to have me indicted before the courts, or if you will sign your name to that statement and give the names of the parties to whom you refer in that statement I will forthwith call you into court.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">The exchange of letters illustrate various important points. It is possible to be public-spirited and make a lot of money at the same time. Being both public-spirited and rich makes it easy to negotiate with local government and convince them of the value of your projects. And, finally, impugning the integrity and public-spiritedness of a rich real estate person can easily lead to a lawsuit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Back to the boulevard system. In its very last meeting of July 6, 1891 the Albina city council awarded the contract for clearing the boulevards to Wolf, Hendricks &amp; Co. The Oregonian of July 7 describes the four boulevards on the peninsula, being 15 miles total, that have been &ldquo;laid out&rdquo;. It also mentions that &ldquo;the boulevard question has occupied the attention of the council to a very great extent&rdquo;. That is putting it mildly -- it almost seems as if in its last year it was the only item on the agenda.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 397.11px; height: 829.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image14.png" style="width: 397.11px; height: 829.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Some notes for clarification: the line between section 21 and 22 intersects the bluff at the west end of Russell Street, at the south end of the Union Pacific Railroad yards. The Abrams and Knox tract was northeast of the railroad yards. The southern part of the proposed boulevard follows a track similar to current N Greeley Avenue. There already was a Willamette Boulevard in the plats of Arbor Lodge and Willamette, running east from Patton Avenue (now Interstate Avenue) to the bluff, and then along the bluff to Portland Boulevard (now Rosa Parks Way). The proposed Vancouver Boulevard, 80 feet wide, &nbsp;runs from Russell to the north line of Piedmont, and is 80 feet wide. It overlaps with, and thus replaces, the old Vancouver Road. Multnomah Boulevard, 100 feet wide, follows the same route as current Interstate Avenue, from Russell north to the Columbia Slough Road (now Columbia Boulevard). Portland Boulevard runs west along what is now Rosa Parks Way starting at Vancouver Road until it intersects Willamette Boulevard on the bluff above Mocks Bottom, then north along the east line of the Arbor Lodge subdivision on what is now N Wabash Avenue, and then west along N Willis Boulevard until N Washburne Avenue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>So this is where the boulevard system was in 1891. Four boulevards approved, and &ldquo;laid out&rdquo;, which presumably means graded. After 1891 there is an ominous silence about the boulevards. There are several possible reasons for this. One is the grandiose promises of real estate salesmen which usually fail to materialize. Second, and more seriously, the 1890&rsquo;s were rocked by serious economic depressions, known as the </span><span class="c3"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1893&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1630364500002000&amp;usg=AOvVaw37pHXDs3qbF4dTLAtcS6ZG">Panic of 1893</a></span><span>&nbsp;and the </span><span class="c3"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1896&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1630364500002000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0rQ387ESA_gwHVt-4JVDGb">Panic of 1896</a></span><span>. Especially the 1893 one, which lasted at least three years, was as almost as serious as the great depression of the 1930&rsquo;s. A quarter of all railroad companies went out of business, &nbsp;</span><span class="c10">five hundred banks closed, fifteen thousand businesses failed, and numerous farms ceased operation. The unemployment rate hit 25% in Pennsylvania, 35% in New York, and 43% in Michigan. That must have depressed real estate sales everywhere, including sales on the Peninsula, in particular in University Park. And finally, the last moments and deeds of the Albina City Council were tainted by graft and incompetence. The Oregonian of October 30, 1899, has an amusing piece about the last days before consolidation. </span><span>Here is a paragraph from that article.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 249.00px; height: 309.14px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 249.00px; height: 309.14px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c8 c12"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Just to tie up a loose end, the four park properties bought by Albina are described in the Oregonian of January 1, 1904.

There is no mention of the Vancouver and Multnomah boulevards, but Portland Boulevard is short and &nbsp;insignificant, and Willamette Boulevard is a mess. In the eight years since grading there has been no graveling or other forms of paving. There is some hope the situation will improve if the boulevards are made county roads, which makes the county responsible for overseeing their maintenance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 283.50px; height: 194.52px;"><img alt="" src="images/image12.png" style="width: 283.50px; height: 194.52px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 295.44px; height: 390.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.png" style="width: 295.44px; height: 390.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">None of this in any way impeded Francis I. McKenna from making additional grandiose plans (and additional money). In the Oregonian of August 28, 1910, he proposes to make the Columbia Slough Road into an 80 feet wide boulevard, running from St. Johns to Troutdale.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5 c1"><span class="c7">On the Peninsula I think we are fortunate in having our fine boulevard system, which is just now being improved and extended. I had a part in the great fight to get that boulevard system, and even then we did not get all we were after. We did not have time to complete our work before consolidation, but what we did get stays. We failed to make Vancouver Avenue an 80 foot boulevard for lack of time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">The rest of the interview is also worth reading. McKenna ignores the fact that it has been twenty years since the grading was done. He also admits that consolidation got in the way of his schemes. Looking back it does indeed seem the incorporation of Albina, which made it possible to issue bonds, the quick annexation of the peninsula after that, and the quick adoption of the boulevard and park schemes, was an elaborate and rather shameless ploy by real estate interests. </span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 571.50px; height: 359.02px;"><img alt="" src="images/image9.png" style="width: 571.50px; height: 359.02px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">McKenna now personally owned more than 1000 lots on the Peninsula. The Saint Johns Review of April 30, 1909 reports he bought 500 lots in University Park for $ 100,000.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5 c1"><span class="c7">Mr. McKenna made this large investment not for the purpose of reselling with with the determination to hold every lot until after the year 1920, at which time he believes no lot favorably situated on the Peninsula can be purchased for less than $100 per front foot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">McKenna himself didn&rsquo;t make it until 1920. He died February 24, 1914. Besides the obvious vindication of starting as a farm-hand and ending up as a multi-millionaire, his boulevard system was also generally seen by 1910 as a great visionary success. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">After the economy improved, and George Williams became mayor of Portland, both the county and the city got serious about paving the main boulevards and streets. Also, Dawson Street and Pippin Street were joined and renamed Lombard Street, which finally did produce something like a central boulevard. The Oregonian of April 28, 1912 sings the praises of the boulevard system, and the idea of running 80 and 100 feet wide boulevards through what was, at the time, &ldquo;the brush that covered most of the Peninsula with an impenetrable mess.&rdquo; The article says that 2.5 million dollars already has been spent on streets north of Killingsworth, with another one million to come in 1912, as well as between one and two million for a sewer system, and up to six million for the industrial area on the Slough. In the Oregonian of January 16, 1913, announces the paving of Willamette Boulevard, together with Wabash Street, Greeley Street, Lombard Street, Patton Avenue (Interstate) and Albina Avenue with hard-surface pavement (asphalt).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Other chapters in this book will detail the history of the important streets in Piedmont that were part of the boulevard system: Lombard Boulevard, Vancouver Avenue, and Portland Boulevard will each have their very own chapter. This chapter, on the Boulevard System, argues that gambling on so-called visionary ideas will only pay off if it is backed up by boundless energy, lots of borrowed money, and by a local government that is willing to accept at least some form of graft. Under capitalism a benefactor is rewarded by being the main beneficiary of the benefactions. Public spiritedness can be a good investment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">References</span></p><p class="c8 c12"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>Wikipedia (retrieved July 5, 2018): </span><span class="c7">Francis I.
