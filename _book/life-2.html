<p>In November 1899 Captain Lewis Love sat down with his granddaughter Harriet LaVelle Peacher and dictated a manuscript with the details of his trek across the plains from Missouri to Oregon, and about his subsequent activities and enterprises in Oregon and Washington. There are <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MQCfxwr4mey_PiVpkSZ_oFy0tVrOQzgg/edit">nine nicely cleaned up and retyped pages</a>. A second <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nt0ZUbwaVefMMAXpaPtUjmRO176ut5LG">seventeen-page manuscript</a>, by Captain Love’s great-granddaughter Clara Love Stone goes through Captain Love’s manuscript and provides many additional details and references. These manuscripts are the holy grail of Lewis Love scholarship. I will refer to them in this chapter as the Love Manuscript and the Love Commentary, with a capital M and a capital C. They are reproduced here in total, because we will use them as the starting point for much of the chapter. As you will see, a great deal of attention is paid to Love’s travels on the Oregon Trail, which probably was the most exciting period of his life, although surely not the most profitable one. In the text we have incorporated the underlined and numbered references to the Love Commentary by Ms. Stone, which follows the Love Manuscript.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Manuscript of Captain Lewis Love</h2>
<pre><code>_(Commenced writing Nov. 1, 1899 and finished Nov. 29, 1899. Dictated to his_


_granddaughter, Harriet LaVelle Peacher )_


_PREFACE_


_Captain Love was born in New York, Chautauqua Co., June 12, 1818. After_


_living there till he was 15 years of age he moved to Fox River Co., Illinois_


_in the year 1833. From there he moved to Missouri in 1845 and crossed the_


_plains to come West in 1849. His mother was part Pennsylvania Dutch and part_


_Yankee; she was born in New York and her name before she was married was Jane_


_Demont (deMott). She was the mother of 6 boys and 2 girls all of which are_


_dead (Nov. 1899) except Captain Lewis Love._


_Mrs. Love, Captain Lewis Love&#39;s wife was born in Tennessee, near a little_


_town called Spy and moved to Illinois in 1833 where she met Mr. Love and they_


_were married in 1836. Mrs. Love&#39;s Mother&#39;s name was Edwards before she was_


_married and Mrs. Love&#39;s name was Griffith. Her Mother was from Tennessee. She_


_was born before the Revolution and has been dead 70 years._


_There was born to Captain Lewis Love and wife six boys and 2 girls, namely_


_Mary C. Love, Melinda Love, Green Love, Lewis Love, Fred Love, William Love,_


_Jeremiah and Joseph beside four children which they raised but never adopted._


_There was three boys drowned, namely William Love and --- and --- (Names_


_not given in the manuscript for the latter two)_


_CIRCUMSTANCES CROSSING PLAINS_


_The train which Captain Lewis Love crossed the plains in started from_


_&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Lawrence Co., Mo&lt;/span&gt;. (1), and when they got thirty miles north of Ft. Scott,_


_they came to high water called the Osage River._


_There was only three families together at that time, so they went to_


_work putting in timbers to make a raft to cross on about 2:00 P.M. Two_


_Cherokee Indians rode up and asked us what we were doing. They were on_


_their way to the gold fields in California. We told them we were putting_


_in timbers to build a raft to cross the high water, so they said for us to_


_turn our teams out and their train would come up that evening with 35_


_wagons and 85 men. So we waited till next morning, then went to work_


_building the raft._


_We got it all together in good shape in a stream called &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Sugar Creek (2)&lt;/span&gt;, this_


_being backwater from the Osage River. We floated down to the Osage so as_


_to be able to cross both streams at once. There we found the river to be_


_very swift, too much so to hold against the current. Then we wondered how_


_we was going to cross. Finally Capt, Love suggested that we take&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt; grapevines (3)&lt;/span&gt;_


_and make ropes. Two or three of the Indians kept interfering till the main_


_body drove the others off and told them to stay until it was time for them_


_to cross. Capt. Love took one man with him and they pounded the vines till_


_they could be beat to make a cable. They made a cable to reach a quarter_


_of a mile and forked it down near the raft to keep it from swinging around_


_so as to pull across straight. We then swam over and took ropes to pull_


_us in the direction we wanted to go. We put one wagon on the raft at a_


_time and each trip the raft would sink knee deep till we struck the swift-_


_est part of the river, then the raft would rise on top and float from there_


_over. We commenced taking things across at 2:00 P.M. and that night at_


_10:00 P.M. everything was over safe. From that on the Cherokees became so_


_much attached to me they would ride three or four miles to see me._


_Soon afterwards Cholera set in and it was not uncommon for four or five_


_cases to be reported in camp, the Cherokees being about the heaviest suf-_


_ferers according to the number, and they died off very fast._


_The Ninth Regiment that crossed the plains that year took them in tow and_


_kept them for several hundred miles until they were able to take care of_


_the teams themselves, then they were discharged. And the last I saw of_


_them was on South Pass in the Rocky Mts. They rode past us four miles and_


_drove back to bid me farewell._


_Not long after we left the Osage River we came to a bluff where we had to_


_let the wagons down by means of trees and ropes. Some of the trees had_


_gashes cut in them fully two inches from letting down so many wagons. We_


_had not traveled far when an axle broke in one of the wagons so we went_


_along up the canyon a ways till we came to some ash trees. We hewed a_


_piece of ash down and made another axle._


_One morning while we were camping at a place called Potowatammy, I went_


_out to hunt up the cattle. When I found them there were 41 missing. The_


_word came that Indians were seen driving them away up the road, The man_


_that was with me wanted to go that way to find them. I told him, No, it_


_was a hook (hoax) to keep us from finding them. I told him I was too well_


_acquainted with the Indians to believe they would steal my cattle. So we_


_struck across the plains about four miles to a high ridge which had quite_


_a stream of water at the foot of it. There I saw three squaws riding across_


_the plains. I hailed them, and as I could talk a little of their language,_


_I asked them if they had seen any cattle. So they motioned up over the_


_ridge where there was three men herding them and just ready to start off_


_with them. I wanted to know of them what they were doing with those cattle,_


_and they said they was sent back by a train about four miles ahead to gather_


_them up. I told them it was no such a thing for my cattle were all branded_


_and there was the brand to show for itself. They had 13 head of oxen of_


_mine which would have left me only one to work. When we got to Ft. Carney_


_(Kearney) I took a man by the name of Miller in the train to assist. The_


_rule was that two men was to stand guard every night and when it came my_


_turn he never would let me go but he would take my place. When we got_


_pretty well to Ft. Laramie there was five men and a wagon came into the_


_train. One of the men was a great big stout fellow and to let him tell_


_it he could whip all the Indians on the plains. They took a  notion one_


_day, quite a number, that he was a coward and along towards night he was_


_pointing out how many pony tracks there was. So they thought they would_


_play a joke on him. It was his night to be on duty, and of course if any_


_Indians came around they knew he would shoot them. One old man in their_


_wagon called &quot;Pap&quot; on account of his age told him he had been an old front-_


_iersman and would like to load his gun for him. So it was loaded with a_


_paper wad, After supper the two men went out on guard. The second man had_


_been informed of the joke so he was all ready for them. A while later five_


_men went out, three of whom had guns, and went around in behind the men and_


_two of them commenced patting on their knees to draw his attention. His_


_bravery left him very suddenly and, making the best speed possible for the_


_camp, told them the Indians were after him and he had come for help. Next_


_morning quite a crowd gathered around in one wagon, and were talking about_


_the Indians&#39; attack and one person asked him how many Indians he really_


_thought there was. He said there was 25 or 30 in front and they occupied a_


_piece of ground the shape of a flatiron, and back of this number their heads_


_stuck up as thick as they could be._


_After we crossed South Platte, apast Ft. Laramie, two or three days&#39; ride,_


_we stopped to noon one day. While we were eating, two men came back a-_


_horseback. They were in haste and wanted us to drive on as they wanted help._


_The time came for the train to start and several more trains drove up and a_


_German man belonging to one of the trains was very much excited over the re-_


_port of the Indians and went on to tell how they would kill us. I went up_


_to him and put my hand on his shoulder and told him he must not talk that way_


_because he was frightening the women and children. He says, &quot;You are right&quot;,_


_and you could hardly hear another word out of him after that. When we got_


_straightened around ready to start, we traveled about two miles, when we_


_found we had to turn around and come back about five miles. We started down_


_Ash Canyon. After going down some distance the same two men came riding_


_back further up on the offside of the teams, yelling for the women and_


_children to get into the wagons, that the Indians were advancing. The men_


_reported 1500 to 2000 Indians. They came on around where I was and I stepped_


_out and told them the same as I told the German man, and if they didn&#39;t stop_


_I would knock them off their horses. As soon as they passed on, I took my_


_gun and went to see what there was over the hill. ‘Iwo women went with me._


_We went to the top of the hill. There we stopped and estimated about 75 or_


_80 Indians out of the 1500 or 2000. ‘Then we went back down the hill and met_


_our teams. We then reported the number of Indians. A great many would not_


_believe us on account of the large number being reported before. We then_


_drove on out to the mouth of the canyon, having about 80 horsemen in front,_


_well-armed. When we got down to where the Indians were we rode on down_


_amongst them and found everything very peaceful after all the scare. It_


_was a remnant of the Sioux tribe who had just been engaged in a battle with_


_a tribe called the Blackfeet. I wanted to know of those fellows after the_


_trains had stopped, why they had made so much fuss about the Indians. They_


_said one Indian made a mark across the road in the dust. Those were the_


_first Indians we had seen since leaving the Potowatammy tribe, so many_


_Indians had left the trail on account of the Whites and we only saw a few_


_buffalo._


_Close to Independence Rock, which was literally covered with names, quite a_


_number of people had gathered together. One train of 52 wagons and car-_


_riages drove up which took passengers and freight. That train held a meet~_


_ing and decided to throw out 1,000 pounds of freight, some offering a dol-_


_lar a pound to get it hauled through. They went to work unloading the freight._


_Amongst other things there was quite a large quantity of powder. They took_


_it and poured it in a circle around quite a large piece of ground out of the_


_kegs; then put a fuse to it and burnt the circle in that way, and a great_


_many articles that was supposed to have been thrown out were shipped in other_


_Wagons._


_After that we came to a great many places where wagons and buggies were left_


_standing different places on the plains. One instance I unhitched from a_


_2-horse wagon and left it standing with the cover on. I asked the people if_


_they objected to my leaving mine and taking the other one. They said no, I_


_was welcome to it, so I changed the load and left my wagon standing with the_


_cover on._


_It was a very common thing for the oxen to get sore feet. So we would take_


_a piece of skin from a dead ox and sew it around the sore feet to keep the_


_sand from getting into them. Nothing more of much importance occurred till_


_we struck the Black Hills. Two men had gone ahead to find a camping place_


_at the foot of the Black Hills, and when they got there they reported no_


_grass to be found -- nothing but sagebrush. They said we would have to tie_


_our cattle up with nothing to eat. I got on my mule and asked if any man_


_would go with me to hunt grass. It was in the P.M. We struck out for a_


_high rocky ridge. When we got about 2/3 of the way to it, the Irishman_


_would not go any further. He said there was no use. I went about a mile_


_and then had to get off my muie and walk, it was so rocky. I went on over_


_the ridge and down to the creek bottom and found some grass and brush, etc._


_I went back and took the cattle over, which gave them 2/3 of a feed. A_


_watchman stayed on the hill overnight. Next morning I went over with the_


_rest to drive the cattle back and then I told them about there being quite_


_a number of Indians camping along the creek. They thought I hadn&#39;t been_


_down there, but after a while they found the camps as I had told then._


_Then we drove on a half day and stopped to noon and a man by the name of_


_Dotworthy and myself went down on the ridges to see if we could find any-_


_thing to shoot. There we picked up a chunk which afterwards proved to be_


_gold. We looked at.it awhile and then threw it down and left it. No doubt_


_the piece was worth $1000.00._


_When we reached Bare River Hills, there we saw the first snow and straw-_


_berry blossoms stick up to the edge of the snow. When we got down to Snake_


_River, we found plenty of Indians. I used to practice lifting with them._


_I had one wagon that was pretty heavily loaded. I would turn my back to_


_the wheel and take hold of the spokes and then motion for some of the big_


_Indians to come and lift it. But I never found but one that could lift it._


_Then the Indians would point to me and say I was so much stronger than they_


_were. When we came to Salmon Falls the Indians came to us every day and_


_wanted to swap salmon for shirts. It didn&#39;t make any difference how ragged_


_they were just so they could get them. Sometimes they would get a little_


_sulky because we wouldn&#39;t trade with them. We traveled all the way down on_


_the South side of Snake River and the first country we found that appeared_


_to be muddy was along Powder River. When we started over Grand Round Valley,_


_I thought it the most beautiful country we had found yet. There I saw the_


_largest bunch of Indian ponies I had ever seen. There were fully 2000 in_


_the number._


_When we started up into the Blue Mountains there for the first time we came_


_into tall timber, and crossing Grand Round (Ronde) River you could see salmon_


_darting in every direction. After crossing the first mountain we found some_


_very rich land. When we crossed the first mountain before we crossed the_


_river there was about a dozen Indians traveled with us for two weeks. I had_


_a spring wagon with me, which the Indians had never seen before. Every night_


_they would deposit a package of some kind in that wagon and would remove it_


_again every morning, and would talk about the wagon and appeared to be very_


_much pleased. They would camp at night and build a fire, and lay two tent_


_poles parallel on the ground; then they would form on each side and sit down_


_with sticks in their hands and commence singing. The first Indian would have_


_a stick sharpened to a point at each end, just long enough so he could hold_


_it in his hands without it being seen. Then he would throw it from one hand_


_to the other and the one that guessed which hand the stick was in got the_


_stick and repeated the same thing. This was their way of gambling. They_


_seemed very much delighted to think they could travel along with us. We_


_traveled over the Columbia River near the mouth of the Umatilla while they_


_were with us._


_There was one man and his mother in the train, and one night we camped on_


_Willow Creek. This man&#39;s name was Morgan and he was in the habit of picking_


_up ail the chains, picks, shovels, etc. he came across until his team was_


_completely broken down. We had to pull his wagon up all the hills, so that_


_night we appointed a committee, I being one of them, to inform him that he_


_must throw out some of those things or we would not help him any more. He_


_refused to do so. Then I told his mother to get into my wagon, and if I_


_reached my destination she would too. She said no, it would be too much_


_trouble. Then a Mr. Person spoke up and said she could ride in his wagon_


_part of the time. She refused the second offer so we had to proceed without_


_them._


_By this time provisions were getting scarce and we had no time to waste. Im-_


_mediately after we left them we came to a mountain that took 14 yoke of oxen_


_to pull up one wagon. The side of the mountain was full of Indians, some on_


_foot and some on horses, watching us get up the mountain. After we all got_


_to the top we proceeded on our journey, and before night Morgan passed us_


_driving his oxen without the wagon. He had sent his mother and provisions_


_and other things with Indians down to the mouth of the Deschutes River. When_


_we reached there a man by the name of Coile went down on the bank of the_


_river and found the old lady in a little tent with the bedding and everything_


_else she had left was on the forward wheels of the wagon. He took her in his_


_wagon and hauled her to The Dalles where she found her son._


_Deschutes River was quite deep and when we crossed the Indians acted as_


_guides. We put a rope around the forward oxens&#39; horns, as the route was_


_somewhat crooked. After I crossed another team started and it got about_


_half way across and refused to go any farther. I got on my mule and took_


_my good yoke of leaders and drove in and hitched them on ahead and pulled_


_them out. In that way we had quite a time getting the oxen turned around_


_in the water as it was very swift. The people in the wagon were so dizzy_


_they could hardly sit in the seat. The Old Methodist National Bldg. was_


_still standing when we reached The Dalles. But there was no white people_


_except one Catholic priest amongst the Indians. There we left our wagons_


_and hired Indians to take us to the Cascades in canoes._


_We went on down the river and got a small flat boat and brought it to the_


_foot of the Cascades, and packed everything on our backs to this boat, the_


_distance being about 5 miles. We then went on down in the boat which leaked_


_so bad we had to keep three or four men bailing all the time to keep it from_


_sinking._


_At the foot of Cape Horn Mts. is where the last bite of bread was eaten in_


_the train. I had been providing provisions for part of the members in the_


_train for nearly 300 miles. That night we came to where we could get plenty_


_to eat again. The first house we came to after crossing the plains was at_


_Washougal and the next one we came to was at Ft. Scott. The man&#39;s name was_


_&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;White &lt;/span&gt;(4)._


_When we got to the Cascades we learned how the Indians made their beds. The_


_shore was very rocky so they would throw out the rocks from a place big_


_enough to lay in and make the sand level and that was their resting place._


_Before leaving The Dalles I hired an Indian at my own expense to drive the cat-_


_tle down the trail as I had about 1/3 of the stock in the train. We crossed_


_the cattle about 10 miles below the Cascades and next day we landed at Cas._


_with stock._


_The next winter I went to work at a sawmill owned by a man named &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Parker&lt;/span&gt; (5) about_


_mile and a half from where we landed. He paid me $5.00 per day and I agreed_


_to work that winter for him. A few days later I was offered work at &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;another&lt;/span&gt;_


_&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;mill at Milwaukie&lt;/span&gt; (6) at $7.00 per day. But as I had promised to work that_


_winter, I stuck to my job. After we were at Parker&#39;s a few days a man and_


_myself took a skift (skiff?) and went to Vancouver for provisions. We got_


_plenty of flour and 30 pounds of pork from soldiers’ rations. A barrel of_


_thin syrup and a little butter so strong that it cured me from eating butter._


_We got the flour from the Hudson Bay Co. six miles above Vancouver. After_


_we left there a heavy wind came up and while we was crossing the river the_


_water kept splashing in the boat, and the other man became frightened. He_


_was pulling and I was steering and he quit, so I said, &quot;Pull, you devil,_


_pull, or we will go down}&quot; So he pulled like a good fellow till we reached_


_the bank. Then we pulled on up near the bank till we got to Washougal._


_After we passed there a little ways the river became so swift that two In-_


_dians had to get in and help us out. One got on each side and pulled us_


_over the worst part. Then we proceeded to where we was going without any_


_help._


_There was only two men in the country that had any stock before we came there._


_One was Mr. Parker and the other an old Hudson Bay fellow that came to Van-_


_couver in 1824. They had drove their cattle off into the rushes over Cape_


_Horn Mts., and immediately afterwards there came a two-foot snow. The river_


_froze over and we had nothing to live on, but that flour and syrup that winter._


_Although I had five men boarding with me but they was glad to get what we did._


_We had bread and molasses for breakfast, and the reverse for dinner and supper._


_In the spring I moved in a little log house joining my &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;farm on Columbia Slough&lt;/span&gt; (7)_


_and soon after we all took the Mountain or Camp Fever, and also ran out of_


_provisions, yet we had good friends. The year before we moved there, there_


_was a good crop of potatoes raised on the place, and that year there was a_


_few volunteer potatoes came up. Our friends, the &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;wood rats&lt;/span&gt; (8), would dig them_


_up and bring them in and pile them up in the log cabin and we would steal_


_them from the rats and make our soup of them. This was our living for some_


_time. We had no doctor only from the Hudson Bay Co. and he charged $50.00_


_per trip besides his ferriage which brought his bill to $52.00. Between him_


_and the wood rats we weathered it through._


_ _


_My farm was then occupied by a man by the name of Webb. He wanted me to buy_


_the place on account of him going to the mines at Snake River. He was almost_


_a total stranger and wanted $1000.00 for the place and stock, which consisted_


_of two yoke of oxen and 3 cows. I finally made a deal with him. I paid $300_


_down and gave him my note for $700 payable in 18 months. After the bargain_


_was closed and the note given, he went out and dug up a good-sized bucket_


_full of money and wanted me to take care of it and also the note I had given_


_him. I told him &quot;No,&quot; and he urged me so that finally I told him I would not_


_like to have anybody know it was about the house. He said I was the only one_


_he would like to keep it and that no one would ever know from him that I had_


_it. The money consisted of Mexican dollars and gold coins. The gold was in_


_$8.00 and $16.00 pieces called single loons and double loons. He said that_


_if he never came back I would be that much better off. I did not see him any_


_more for 18 months, although the mines he spoke of had never been discovered._


_Soon after that Capt. Banburgan and Bradfords above the Cascades brought emi-_


_gration down on a boat to the Cascades and took cattle for pay, and bought_


_also a large number of cattle and sent them down for me to sell, which gave_


_me something of a start. I also took jobs of work, times being good. The_


_old settlers had been to the mines and came back with quite a little money,_


_They being too good to work after making a fine start. The first summer I_


_cleared $8.25 per day outside of my commissions on sales. Lumber at that_


_time was worth $100.00 per thousand feet, and I went to work hauling lumber_


_from &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Will&#39;s Mill&lt;/span&gt; (6) to the river. When I went to work on Monday, I would take_


_a cedar saw log on my wagon and get it sawed and Saturday when I went home_


_I would buy a little more lumber. I was in need of a house very bad, so I_


_went to work and hewed out sills and studding, and cut white fir timber and_


_made clab boards and shaved them for siding. When I got it up and painted_


_very few people ever noticed the difference from sawed lumber. At that time_


_it was the best locking house in the country. I spent a great deal of ny_


_time boring holes in burnt down trees and burning them up to clear a place_


_to live on. After I had burnt off a great deal of timber in that way, I_


_took a notion to cut the timber in saw logs and bring it to Portland, which_


_consisted of about 15 or 20 buildings at that time. It was expressed along_


_the river that I was a big fool for trying to get out saw logs when there_


_wasn&#39;t a boat on the river to tow with. But I had quite a number of oxen._


_I thought I could put the logs in the Slough and raft them as cheap as I_


_could burn them._


_There came a high water the next summer, and I had got in about 300,000 ft._


_and started them for Portland. We kept close around Gattens Point and went_


_out into the Willamette opposite Sauvies Island. Before starting I went to_


_Vancouver and got four old government tents, put up masts on the rafts and_


_stayed them with lines and stretched these tents up for sails. In a little_


_over four hours we landed in Portland. Soon after this there was quite a_


_number of other fools in the same business. Logging was carried on all_


_along the Slough. I then took a contract for quite a large number of logs,_


_the pay of which was to be part sawing and part money. When I got almost_


_ready to start the logs to Portland, I received a word that the parties were_


_broke. So I came to Portland and went to &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Mr. Mills the contractor&lt;/span&gt; (9) and told_


_him I heard he was broke, and told him I could not make the contract on_


_those conditions. Then I went back and got my logs ready and brought them_


_to Portland. So he offered to let me run the mill a month free. I told_


_him I would not start it for a month&#39;s run at all. He then wanted to sell_


_me the mill. I think I made about four bargains with him before he would_


_stand to it. I finally &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;bought the mill&lt;/span&gt; (10) to save myself on the logs, the_


_raft being fully 3/4 of a mile long. I ran the mill a while, then &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;sold out&lt;/span&gt;_


_&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;mill&lt;/span&gt; (10) and logs, there being $6,000 due me. They kept insisting for me to_


_wait longer and longer for the money, till &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;I waited six years&lt;/span&gt; (10) and had to_


_take my pay in greenbacks which were only worth 50¢ on the dollar._


_Before there was any steamers here and also before this logging contract,_


_I took up a contract to bring up logs in the winter time. I think they_


_were to be at Portland some time in January. I was not much acquainted_


_with currents here and during this time there came a raise of about four_


_or five feet in the Willamette, and I first thought I was not going to be_


_able to get the logs to Portland. I came in and told the parties I didn&#39;t_


_think I could quite fulfill my promise on account of the raise in the_


_river. So they said they would take them any time I could get them here._


_I went and bought a coil and a half of rope and spliced it together and_


_pinned some logs together and made a windlass with a long sweep. I put_


_that in a boat and would go up stream with it the length of the line._


_I put two men on the sweep to make it fast, then go back and take turns at_


_Captain, and one man to coil up the rope. We brought that up the river_


_against a pretty strong current, making about 3/4 of a mile a day, and_


_we reached Portland in 16 days._


_In 1857 I went into the &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;merchandise business&lt;/span&gt; (10A) in Portland and had about_


_the largest retail store in town. After running it some time I became_


_too weakly to attend it, so had to put a man in charge by the name of_


_&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Z. N. Stansbury&lt;/span&gt; (11). He was &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;elected County Treasurer and four of us went&lt;/span&gt;_


_&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;his bonds&lt;/span&gt; (11), and was the defaulter for $ 8,000.00. What I lost in the way_


_of bonds and goods from the store through him made me the loser of about_


_$11,000.00. I was so bad with kidney complaint that I was not able to_


_be out of bed. There was an old doctor by the name of Millard in Port-_


_land well known to the old settlers. He gave me four large doses of_


_calomel within about a week. The last dose commenced operating and I_


_felt my kidneys break loose and drop back about an inch and a half as_


_near as I could tell, and after that I felt like a new man._


_The next spring after this, I think it was in 1859, I fitted up a team _


_and went East of the mountains. I had made arrangements with &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Colonel&lt;/span&gt;_


_&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Rubble&lt;/span&gt; (11A)  to take me to The Dalles on his boat, and within about a week after_


_the arrangements were made he sold out to the 0.R.&amp; N.Co., leaving me out_


_in the cold. I then chartered the &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;steamer Independence&lt;/span&gt; (12) and went to the_


_Cascades on her. We camped there two weeks and then proceeded on up the_


_river on a large scow that came down after us. I took a skift (skiff?)_


_and went up and met them and piloted from there down. Then the whole_


_company got very good and offered to take me to The Dalles on most any_


_terms. But I told them I had a conveyance to go up on so we loaded up_


_and went ahead. We had a good breeze and went up quite rapidly. Some_


_of the parties on the scow didn&#39;t understand the navigating of the scow_


_very well and was about to drift her into the rocks on the Washington_


_side. I said a man by the name of Vants to pick up a large 2-ft. plank_


_that was on board and drop it over the side for a lay board to keep her_


_from going onto the rocks and then we soon brought her over to &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Crates&lt;/span&gt;_


_&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt; (13). There we landed and took our stock and teams off. This was about_


_3 miles below The Dalles. Then we traveled at leisure, killing prairie._


_chickens and broiling them on the coals for our living. From Crates_


_Point went on to Walla Walla by land, leaving two wagons at The Dalles_


_and taking two with us. When we arrived at Walla Walla I sold my ox team._


_An Indian agent was there for the purpose of protecting the Indians._


_Across the river was a tent where the white people sold liquor to the_


_Indians. They got the Indians drunk and while they were in that dazed_


_condition they took about 150 or 200 ponies belonging to the Indians,_


_and took them off down the valley and sold them. This is the way the_


_Indians were “protected” there._


_ After we got to Walla Walla there was going to be a &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;flour mill&lt;/span&gt; (13A) raised_


_which belonged to a man by the name of &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Reynolds&lt;/span&gt; (13A). Captain Black and the_


_Indian agent owned the ground for the millsite. So the Indian agent was_


_sent out to invite the men to the raising of the mill. They learned that_


_I was there so they told him not to come back without me, After he found_


_me and I promised to come he said they had a certain duty for me to pe -_


_form. I asked him what it was and he said it was &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;to keep Reynolds in a&lt;/span&gt;_


_&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;good humor&lt;/span&gt; (13A). The men worked out in the hot sun where it was almost un-_


_bearable to be and Mr. Reynolds’ head got so hot that it kept him in a_


_bad humor. He used such abusive language that several of the men quit_


_work and left. So I got the rest of them in a cluster and told them not_


_to get angry at whatever he might say. I soon discovered that he was_


_completely overcome with the heat. So I told him to tell me which way_


_the timbers went and he did, so we soon had the mill up. Although we had_


_no sawed timbers to put in, all being hewed, even the braces and studding,_


_it twisted around so in the hot sun that it’ was hard to get together, but_


_finally it came out all right._


_After that we visited Whitman&#39;s Station, expecting to find the handsomest_


_place in the valley. Although a pretty fair place, the site selected for_


_it was between two hills that came near together right in the Indians’ pass_</code></pre>
<p><em>way. There was two small pair of millstones dressed out of the rock found</em></p>
<pre><code>_there to put up a small mill where the Indians could get their corn ground._


_Then we returned to Portland and I bought a &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;sawmill at Vancouver&lt;/span&gt; (14), and ex-_


_pected to get the government trade. I kept it for a while but as I charged_


_them the same as I did everybody else I lost their trade. I built a &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;grist&lt;/span&gt;_


_&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;mill to it&lt;/span&gt; (15), and it afterwards &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;burnt&lt;/span&gt; (15) without any insurance. I then built_


_a &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;grist and sawmill where the Hudson Bay Co. had theirs&lt;/span&gt; (16). After running_


_that quite a while (16A), it became flooded with high water and several of us_


_took the notion to go to boating._


_We had a meeting. Myself, Farnsworth and J. D. Biles were elected direct-_


_ors. It was almost all thrown onto my shoulders. So I went out to &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Salmon&lt;/span&gt;_


_&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Creek and rented a mill&lt;/span&gt; (17). I took some men out to dig up the trees with long_


_roots on one side for the bottom timbers of the boat. I would go out one_


_morning and saw till the next evening and bring a load in with me. Farns-_


_worth was a good builder and he wanted to build the boat. Then I had to_


_take charge of the planking under his directions. The O.R.&amp;N. Co. made fun_


_of us, they having two large boats brought here from the East. I made a_


_contract to have the machinery made in Portland. We sent to California for_


_the silders and a few other things, and they were sent up to be finished_


_here. The boiler was too light and before we got through it broke up._


_Then I hired a young man by the day whose name was Dehuff, to finish up the_


_machinery. I got the shop for him to work in, and when it was finished we_


_started to put it in the boat._


_About that time there was an organization of the Peoples&#39; Transportation_


_Co. and we gave them the job of raising the machinery. When it was com-_


_pleted we had the fastest boat on the river. Her name was the &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;E. D. BAKER&lt;/span&gt; (18)._


_Then I commenced getting out timbers for another boat above the Cascades (18A)._


_I hauled the timber to my own mill and sawed it and sent it above the Cas-_


_cades. We finished that boat and called her the IRIS. We also had an-_


_other boat above Deschutes River. At last a dispute arose between the two_


_companies, to see which would have the route on the Columbia. We commenced_


_cutting rates, till we carried passengers from Portland to The Dalles for_


_50¢. Both companies run in debt until Mr. Ladd made a proposition to com-_


_promise. We gave them two steamboats and freight boats on the Columbia,_


_keeping the E.D. BAKER, and they gave us 7 steamboats and freight boats on_


_the Willamette and $10,000 in cash for us to get off of the Columbia and_


_they got off of the Willamette._


_Then we went to work and put in a &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;breakwater at Oregon City&lt;/span&gt; (19) 1½  mi. in_


_length and built a &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;basin at the falls &lt;/span&gt;to run into. Then we built a &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;shoot&lt;/span&gt;_


_&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;to get the freight down to the boats&lt;/span&gt; below. I stayed in that business_


_several years and sold out. After I sold out, stock commenced running down_


_till it got to about 30¢ on the dollar, and then a man by the name of Holla-_


_day bought out the whole thing,_


_I then came to Portland and went into the furniture business. I built me a_


_large store (18B) and had it all quite nicely furnished and the big fire of 1873_


_burnt it up and nearly everything in it, without any insurance. Then I had_


_to recruit a few years before I could do much more. A few years after that_


_I put up some &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;brick buildings &lt;/span&gt;(20) and also some &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;wooden ones&lt;/span&gt;, which I have yet_


_except what I have given to the heirs._


_The year of 1899, Nov. 29, about four months ago, I commenced to build a_


_&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;new residence&lt;/span&gt; (21), and expect to put quite a few men to work making more im-_


_provements in a few days. I have been sought after for some time &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;forging&lt;/span&gt;_


_&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;wills and deeds&lt;/span&gt; (22) for a large amount of my property. I have stood them off_


_so far and some others have stood the penalty of the law._</code></pre>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Proof of Statements Made in Manuscript of Captain Lewis Love</h2>
<pre><code>_(Compiled by Clara Love Stone in 1950&#39;s. Reviewed and consolidated by Greg Bettis 1986)_</code></pre>
<p><em>(1) Excerpt from letter from the State Historical Society of Missouri, Columbia, Mo.,</em></p>
<pre><code>_dated October 31, 1952: “Our librarian reports that she is unable to identify_


_the place in Missouri known as Laurence, from which the Love family are said to_


_have started West. There was and is today a Lawrence County in the Southwestern_


_part of the State, but we have no way of knowing whether the county is meant in_


_the reference to the point of departure of the Love family.&quot;_


_Excerpt from a letter from the Missouri Historical Society, St. Louis, Mo.,_


_dated September 20, 1952: &quot;A Missouri state gazetteer of 1860 lists Lawrence,_


_a post office of Oregon County, but it is not included in the gazetteers which_


_we have for 1867 and 1875. Furthermore, there is no comprehensive history of_


_Oregon County so that it is difficult to check family names.&quot;_


_(2) &quot;Sugar Creek&quot; and possibly other names contained in this manuscript may not ap-_


_pear in today&#39;s records; but, as the town of Lawrence, Mo., did exist in 1849._


_(3) The Garden Dictionary reports twenty to thirty species of wild grape on the Con-_


_tinent, and particularly mentions the natural habitat as being borders of lakes_


_and rivers. They are common in most of the States. The &quot;Grapevine Mountains&quot;_


_are located on the Southwest line of Nevada, bordering California; no doubt so_


_called on account of the prevalence of wild grapes in the area._


_(4) Early records indicate a man by the name of White was living in the area mentioned._


_(5) David Parker is listed on the 1850 Clark County census as living in the area. Also_


_donation land claim records reveal: &quot;Ctf #213, David C. Parker, 582 acres Sec. 11,_


_12,13,14, T7, 1N 3-4) E. Washougal&quot;. Lewis Love later purchased a portion of this_


_property. See Book B, P. 407 and Book M., P. 386 - Clark County Courthouse._


_At the present time (1953) it is not generally believed there was a sawmill at_


_Washougal in 1849. The Oregonian (7/4/1903) stated in an article at the time of_


_death of Captain Love: &quot;The family arrived at Parkers Landing in November 1849,_


_and remained there the first winter » Captain Love working in a mill at Washougal.&quot;_


_(6) Bond - Jacob Wills to Benjamin F. Smith, Geo. W. Wills and Wm. Purvine dated May 9, 1860:  &quot;Has this day sold to Benj. F, Smith, Geo. W. Wille and Wm. Purvine his saw-_


_mill situated in Multnomah County, etc. etc. Recorded June 6, 1860 on P. 707,_


_Bk B. According to Henry Richardgon of Portlend City Engineers, the above mill was_


_located East of Sellwood, and probably near S. W. McLoughlin Blvd._


_(7) This 640 acre farm, known as the Love Donation Land Claim (Ctf 148k; Notification_


_No. 293) is bounded on the East by 8th St.; on the South by Bryant St.; on the West_


_by Minnesota St.; and extends North beyond Columbia Slough; and it embraces the_


_old Love Cemetery (now known as Columbian Cemetery), several residential sections,_


_a City Park, and many business enterprises, including the National Biscuit Company_


_plant, Vancouver Ave. and Columbia Blvd. Captain Love operated a ferry on this_


_property in the early 1850&#39;s across Love&#39;s Slough as the first step toward a direct_


_route between Portland and Vancouver._


_We learn from Fred Lockley&#39;s &quot;History, etc.&quot; Vol. 1, P. 529: “The first money paid_


_Into the treasury of Multnomah County was $10.00 for a license to run a ferry. The_


_first meeting of the County Commissioners of Multnomah County was on Jan. 17, 1855._


_On April 4, 1855 petition was presented regarding rate of ferriage. It was ordered_


_by the court that Lewis Love be allowed the following rates for ferrying across the_


_Slough at his place, situated between Portland and Switzler&#39;s ferry: for wagon and_


_animal 25¢; man on horseback 10¢; foot passenger 5¢; loose animals 5¢. It also is_


_ordered that he pay a license fee of $5.00 per year. It would certainly seem that if_


_a man paid $2.00 to have himself and team ferried across the Columbia by John Switzler and 25¢ additional to be ferried across the Columbia Slough by Lewis Love, he was paying plenty; but on July 3, 1855, at the first meeting of the new board of County Commissioners, consisting of Samel Farman, Ellis Walker and Dana Powell, application was made by Lewis Love to have a new schedule of charges allowed. The old record of this action reads: “Relative to the application of Lewis Love to run a ferry on the road from Portland to Switzler&#39;s on the Columbia, across the Slough at his place, it was ordered that the following rates be established for the ensuing year: Foot passengers 12½ ¢; horse and mule 12½ ¢; man on horse 25¢; wagon and one horse 37½ ¢; wagon with two horses 50¢.&quot;_


_Excerpt from Oregonian 4/26/1897: &quot;It was he (Capt. Love) who ran that road (main road between Portland and Vancouver) through to the Columbia Slough, and he was supervisor of the road for a long time. It was Capt. Love, by the way, who took the initiatory steps in getting the boundaries of Multnomah County established.&quot; Road Survey No. 36, Bk 1, P. 61 states: &quot;Note of survey of proposed change in road leading from the ferry landing in East Portland (Stark St.) to Love&#39;s ferry on the Columbia River, and known as the Vancouver Road, filed June 25, 1867.&quot;_


_Capt. Love deeded three acres along the west boundary of the farm as a cemetery, which is today known as Columbian Cemetery ( Recorded 1/22/1868 in Bk H, P. 187), making provision in his will for a plot at the northwest corner just outside of the original_


_cemetery with a 2-ft. walkway around it, as the final resting place of himself and his_


_wife Nancy M. Love._


_At the time of Capt. Love&#39;s death in 1903 the farm contained some 767 acres, and ex-_


_tended north to Force&#39;s Lake. The area between the Slough and the OR&amp;N tracks was developed as a farm, with meadows, cultivated areas, orchards, gardens, and some wooded sections, with possible some nine miles of fencing. The portion south of the OR&amp;N tracks was a wooded area, known as Love&#39;s Woods. Thereafter Love&#39;s Woods was platted into the following additions: Fairport (bet. Minnesota and Albina); Swinton (bet. Albina and Kerby); Green C. Love Addition and Lovewood (bet. Kerby and Vancouver Ave.); Loveleigh (bet. Vancouver Ave. and Rodney); Love&#39;s Addition (bet. Rodney and Union Ave.); and El Tovar (bet. Union Ave. and 8th St.)._


_Newspaper clipping: &quot;LOVELEIGH&quot; is the name_


_Portland, Oregon, March 28, 1908_


_Brong-Steele Co., 110 Second Street_


_Gentlemen: When you advertised for the most appropriate name for your beautiful_


_tract of land which is part of the Lewis Love homestead, and being so well ac-_


_quainted with the land and the beautiful view which I get of the majestic snow-_


_capped mountains of St. Helens, Adams and Hood, also the panoramic view of the_


_beautiful hills across the mighty Columbia into Clarke County, the name of_


_&quot;Loveleigh&quot; came to me as the most appropriate one to give to this beautiful_


_addition. As the first part of the name is given in honor of Captain Lewis_


_Love, who entered the land as a donation land claim over 50 years ago, and the_


_last part of the name signified a broad expanse of beautiful fields or lovely_


_Country,_


_Not - &quot;The lowing herds wind slowly o&#39;er the lea,&quot;_


_Not - &quot;A thousand demons lurk within the lee,&quot;_


_But - &quot;The well-known Love&#39;s old home, &quot;Loveleigh.&quot;_


_I hereby acknowledge the payment of sum of $10.00 in payment of the name &quot;LOVE-_


_LEIGH&quot;. Wishing you success in selling this beautiful addition, as it is un~_


_doubtedly the finest part of the city of Portland for homes, and thanking you_


_for the same, I am,_


    _Cordially yours,_


_(Signed)   ORENA F. RATER _

_From the Oregonian of July 10, 1903: &quot;MAY EXTEND UNION AVENUE. Residents of the extreme portion of the city in Piedmont and thereabouts are now in hope that_


_Union Avenue will be extended through the Love tract to the Slough Road, or, as_


_it appears on the map, Columbia Boulevard. Strenuous efforts to secure this_


_extension have been made for years but have always been opposed by Captain Love._


_Twice he has contested the extension in the courts and won his suit. Only a_


_short time ago the Council again took steps to have Union Avenue extended, and_


_now that Captain Love is dead, and his heirs will probably not object to as_


_speedy a division of his property as possible, it is hoped that the desired ex-_


_tension of Union Avenue will be made.&quot;_


_(8) For more complete story about woodrats see article published in the Oregonian_


_under date of Apr. 26, 1897 - &quot;Grant in Oregon:, Lewis Love ferried him across_


_Columbia Slough.&quot;_


_(8-A) Excerpt from Oregonian 1/26/1897: &quot;Captain Love built and occupied the first_


_house on the main road between Portland and Vancouver. This home was located_


_on the northeast corner of Vancouver Avenue and Columbia Blvd., and still stands_


_today (1956), having in recent years been moved about a block directly east,_


_remodeled, and now bears No. 5 North Columbia Blvd.”_


_(8-A) Agricultural list enumerated by Jos. L Meek 10/15/1850 for Clackamas County_


_shows as follows during year ending 6/1/1850: Working oxen 10; milk cows 6;_


_other cattle 11; swine 6; value of livestock $1100; 30 bushels of Irish potatoes;_


_100 acres improved land; 540 acres unimproved land; value of farming implements_


_&amp; machinery $150; cash value of farm $1000._


_(8-B) Per Dorothy Johansen of Reed College (letter 4/6/1954): &quot;The Banburgan he mentions in connection with Bradford was probably &quot;Van Bergen&quot;, I forget, and I&#39;ve_


_not the time just now to check, but I think the Bradfords had their boat on the_


_middle passage of the river (that is between the Cascades and The Dalles) in_


_1852 or thereabouts&quot;. _

_Hogue: Lots 1,2,7 &amp; 8 in Blk 101, with the steam sawmill thereon, City of_


_Portland, Territory of Oregon. Dated Dec. 18, 1858. Recorded Feb. 15, 1859_


_in Bk B, P. 202. (This sawmill was located at the foot of Clay St.)_


_(10-A) See Mult. Courthouse Case #837. Lewis Love vs. G. W. Brown. This was a suit_


_on an indebtedness of $118 owing to Love-Turpin &amp; Co. &quot;for goods, wares and_


_merchandise bought of said Lewis Love by this affiant.&quot; &quot;On this 22nd day of_


_November 1559 before me, D. W. Lichtenthaler, Clerk of the Circuit Court of_


_the State of Oregon, for the County of Mult., personally came the said G. W._


_Brown, also the plaintiff Lewis Love, in person, and with the assent of said_


_plaintiff said defendant confesses judgment in favor of said plaintiff in the_


_sum of $118, together with interest and costs.&quot;_

_to law, and entered upon the discharge of his duties as such Treasurer. That_


_said bond was in the penal sum of $20,000 and said Love, Weatherford, Davis_


_and Peter Taylor were the sureties of said Stansbury on said bond. That said_


_Stansbury after he was qualified as Treasurer, as aforesaid, received moneys_


_belonging to said County, and before the first day of January, 1860, said Stans-_


_bury absconded from the State to parts unknown and became a defaulter to said_

_Quoting from &quot;History of the Columbia River Valley from The Dalles to the_


_Sea&quot; by Fred Lockley, Vol. 1, P. 39:_


_&quot;Six miles up the Columbia River Dr. McLoughlin established a gristmill and_


_gaymill and shipped in the Hudson&#39;s Bay Company ships salt salmen, flour, and_


_lumber to the Sandwich Islands. From 182 to 1847, when the headquarters of_


_the company was moved to Victoria, Vancouver was the commercial metropolis of_


_the Pacific Northwest. So just and firm was the control of Dr. McLoughlin_


_over the Indians that from 1824 to 1846 we had no Indian wars.&quot;_


_(16-A) The Oregon Historical Society have a crank, or shaft, the card on which reads:_


_&quot;Used in the first sawmill in any part of the United States West of the Rocky_


_Mountains. This was built by Dr. John McLoughlin, chief factor of the Hudson&#39;s_


_Bay Company, in 1827-1828 on a small stream that entered the Columbia River six_


_miles East of Vancouver, Washington, capacity 1500 ft. a day. This was the be-_


_ginning of the lumber industry on the Pacific Coast. The first cargo of lumber_


_shipped from this mill was sent to China in 1833. Presented by Lewis Love,_


_Portland, Oregon.&quot;_


_Letter from Pearl Shepard, Goldendale, Wn. dated 11/21/1949: &quot;Dad remembers_


_when the shaft was moved from the mill pond. It was resting end-ways with_


_only about six inches of it sticking out of the water. Grandpa Love was there_


_the day it was moved. Uncle Lou was sick at the time. He says it was in 1902,_


_either in Nov. or Dec. on a Sunday. Uncle Dick Shepard and Dad (Jim) moved it_


_with their team. Grandpa gave them $25.00 for their work. They hauled it to_


_the dock at Ellsworth and from there it was shipped to Portland by steamer.&quot;_

_Excerpts from article appearing in the Oregonian under date of Aug. 12, 1949:_


_&quot;HISTORICAL SOCIETY GETS 1828 GRIST MILL STONES_


_Grist mill stones which ground out flour starting in 1828, signaling the first_


_food industry in the Northwest, were turned over today by Sig Unander to the_


_Oregon Historical Society. ‘Two of the four large granite-like disks today were  _


_Loaded onto a truck at the site of the first grist mill, located seven miles_</code></pre>
<p><em>East of Vancouver, Wash., on the Evergreen highway. They were taken</em></p>
<pre><code>_to the national park service workshop at the site of old Fort Vancouver where_


_Louis Caywood, park service archeologist, will repair them. Later they will_


_be set up in an exhibit of large historical relics. The mill was built on_


_Love&#39;s creek ….._


_The grist stones were sent to Fort Vancouver from Great Britain by ship_


_around South America. They are made of skillfully fitted blocks laid in a_


_base of cement made from coral shipped in from the Hawaiian Islands. The_


_original iron bands which bound them together are still on them and one stone_


_still has its iron core. One of the stones which had lain untended for scores_


_of years broke into sections when it was lifted to the truck. The other stone_


_is in better repair. Both will be restored eventually to working order….._


_Pollard said that with the help of the park service more material will be ex-_


_cavated at sites of other Hudson&#39;s Bay Company posts as well as at Fort Clat-_


_sop, winter camp site of the Lewis &amp; Clark expedition. When arranged the ma-_


_terial will be the largest and most interesting display of early Oregon his-_


_torical relics, he said._


_Unander, who has investigated the history of the stones, said they are 42_


_inches in diameter and cost 28 pounds a pair when made in England. They were_


_assembled and cemented together apparently after reaching Fort Vancouver._


_The stones had been on the original mill site since they were first taken_


_there. Unander, who had owned the property for several years, brought them_


_to the attention of the society and offered them to the historical organiza-_


_tion for preservation. The society plans to dig for artifacts at the site of_


_a wharf and where the mill was located on the Unander property.”_


_(The above article is accompanied with a photograph, described as follows:_


_&quot;New Girth For Old Stone - Steel bends are jacketed around millstone. part of_

_About the time (a few years ago) when interest was perhaps the keenest in the_


_minds of historians and others of the historical significance of this Hudson&#39;s_


_Bay mill property, the birthplace of the great Northwest lumber industry was_


_sold for residential purposes. Bulldozing was promptly begun at the outlet of_


_the mill stream into the Columbia for the purpose of widening and deepening_


_the area for a suitable moorage (garage) for a seaplane and yacht, which proved_


_to be something of an undertaking when they ran into the multitude of laminated_


_and hardened lumber and bark left by the Hudson&#39;s Bay Company, which had in the_


_meantime for the most part rested beneath soil and water. The old mill site is_


_picturesque with its beautiful new homes, removed as it is from the general_


_public with the recent opening of the new Camas-Washougal highway some distance_


_to the North. Nor is there even a road marker on the old highway, or the new_


_highway, revealing this historic site._


_(17) Louis Lieser, who took up a DLC 4 miles East of Vancouver, later operated a_


_sawmill 14 miles Northeast of Vancouver on Salmon Creek. This &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;may have been&lt;/span&gt;_


_the mill referred to. Also Isaac Dietderick operated a sawmill on Salmon Creek._</code></pre>

_nection with the Dietderick sawmill property._


_(18) From Lewis &amp; Dryden Marine History: &quot;Peter W. DeHuff became well known and admired as a steamboat engineer.&quot; He was mentioned among engineers who had their_


_licenses renewed in 1862, the year the E. D. Baker was built. His biographical_


_®k@tch (including picture) is on P. 124. |_


_Much has been written about the content of this paragraph, particularly in the_


_Lewis &amp; Dryden Marine History, confirming the story as told by Capt. Love, al-_


_though in no way linking his name with the boating venture. Obviously, however,_


_Lewis Love was associated in this boating venture, and with the Peoples Trans-_


_Portation Company._


_Lewis &amp; Dryden (P. 115): &quot;More new boats were constructed in 1863 than in any_</code></pre>
<p><em>previous year. That was the year the E. D. Baker and Iris were built. The Baker</em></p>
<p><em>was the crack boat of the Peoples Transportation Co. fleet and was one of the</em></p>
<pre><code>_fastest sternwheelers that appeared on the Columbia. She was launched at Van-_


_COuver and immediately after completion was put on the Cascades routes….._


_After the two big companies compromised the steamer made a few regular trips on_


_the Willamette and finally sank near Oswego. She was raised afterward but her_


_hull was in poor condition and the engines were removed and placed in the Re-_


_liance and subsequently in the Alice......While her life was brief her good wark_


_on the Cascades run during the struggle for supremacy between the two companies_


_probably hastened the settlement of the controversy._


_The Str. Iris was constructed at the Cascades by master builder Biles. She was_


_a very fast steamer for that period.......She was a short-lived steamer and early_


_in the 70&#39;s was dismantled and her engines, which were 16 x 72 inches, were taken_


_to The Dalles and remodeled, afterward being sent to the lower river where they_


_were placed in a steamer intended for the Astoria run._


_Above The Dalles, the business of the Peoples Transportation Co. was handled by_


_the steamer Kiyus, a small sternwheeler run by Capt. Leonard White. Thus_


_equipped, the new system was in position to demand the generous concession re-_</code></pre>
<p><em>ceived from the Oregon Steam Navigation Co., when the settlement was arranged,</em></p>
<pre><code>_J. D. Biles was mentioned on P. 196 as Secretary and Treasurer of the Peoples_


_Transportation Co. after it was purchased by Ben Holladay, who appointed himself_


_President, and his son, Ben Holladay, Jr., Vice-President. The company then had_


_10 steamers on the Willamette.&quot;_


_The Str. E. D. Baker was named for Col. E. D. Baker, who was known as &quot;The Old_


_Gray Eagle&quot; (OHQ V9, P. 11). No doubt Lewis Love was one of his admirers. A_


_hotel owned by Lewis Love in Portland (Front &amp; Clay Streets) was also known as_


_&quot;The Gray Eagle&quot; Hotel, no doubt for this same man._


_Excerpt from letter from National Archives, Washington, D. C, dated Aug. 31,_


_1950 to Clara Stone: &quot;No record of vessels named E. D. Baker and Iris has been_


_found. Lewis Love of Washington Territory, however, owned the sloop scow IDA ANN_


_(Official Number 12456) from March 22, 1871 to January 27, 1873, but no final end_


_of the vessel has been found. She had one deck, one mast, a square stern, flat_


_bottom, a square head and measured: 81&#39; x 16&#39; x 4&#39; with a tonnage of 34.65 tons._


_She was built at &quot;Loves Millis&quot; in Clark County, W. T., in 1866.&quot;_


_Apparently there are no records linking the name of Capt. Lewis Love as having_


_participated in the building of the &quot;E. D. Baker&quot;, &quot;Iris&quot;, etc, However the 1850_


_anc 1860 Federal Census for Clark County is rather strong evidence of his parti-_


_cipation in this &quot;boating&quot; venture; and it is not unlikely that he may have had_


_the leading role in it as stated in the manuscript: &quot;It was almost all thrown on_


_my shoulders&quot;._

_#* These two names show house numbers as follows: Lewis Love, House No. 150_


_John B. Karrall, House No. 151_


_This would indicate a close affiliation, either the house numbers referring to_


_the two mill buildings, or they lived on adjacent properties. Since there is no_


_&quot;Flour Miller&quot; listed on the 1850 census, it might be presumed that Mr. Karrall_


_operated the flour mill which Lewis Love built adjacent to his sawmill. No_


_Lumber Miller is listed on the 1850 census, as such._


_(18-A)The above, together with the fact that Lewis Love was the owner of the Vancouver Steam Sawmill property which &quot;ran to low water mark&quot; on the Columbia River, in_


_Vancouver, would indicate this property as the likely location of where the boat_


_E. D. BAKER was built. It is likely also, since the Archives in Washington, D. C._


_show the sloop scow IDA ANN to have been built at &quot;Loves Mills&quot; in Clark County_


_in 1866, that this boat, and maybe others, were built at &quot;Loves Mills&quot; - operat-_


_ing at that time both in West Vancouver and on the Hudson&#39;s Bay property six miles_


_East of Vancouver. He purchased the latter in 1862 and on which he erected both_


_a@ sawmill and a grist mill._


_Ad appearing in Vancouver Register for many months, 6/2/1866 and thereafter:_


_COLUMBIA RIVER MILLS!_


_(These extensive mills are situated six miles above Vancouver, on the_


_Washington Territory side of the river)_


_&quot;The owner takes this method of informing the public that he has a con-_


_venient way of hoisting and lowering the boats, and that he is now pre-_


_pared to grind any amount of grain that may be brought to his mill, both_


_by land and water. Custom work is especially solicited. Graham flour_


_made to order.&quot;_


_&quot;My large sawmill immediately adjoining my grist mill is almost complete._


_In a short time I shall be prepared to manufacture all kinds of lumber_


_and saw up any amount of logs that can be hauled or rafted to my mill.&quot;_


_LEWIS LOVE, Proprietor_


_(18=B) Vancouver Register, March 16, 1867: FIRE = On Saturday night last Mr, Love&#39;s_


_(19)_


_sawmill below town was discovered to be on fire. The alarm was immediately given_


_and the fire department turned out promptly and soon succeeded in the extinguish-_


_ment of the fire. The damage was not very great. The fire.was undoubtedly the_


_work of an incendiary, the mill not having been occupied or used for some time_


_past. In this connection we may state that we have been requested by Mr. Love,_


_the proprietor, to return his sincere thanks to the fire department and to the_


_citisens generally for their efforts to preserve his property from destruction._


_This project, as in the case of the &quot;boating venture&quot; is not associated in North-_


_west history with the name of Lewis Love, although credit is given to Peoples_


_Transportation Company. Lewis &amp; Dryden states: &quot;Peoples constructed the canal_


_and basin at Oregon City (on the East side just above the present Publishers_


_Paper Company (ex+Hawley mill)) and enjoyed a long period of success until the_


_completion of the locks at West. Linn by another company. Peoples had invested a large amount of money in building the basin above the falls to facilitate_


_in the trans-shipment of freight, which would have been rendered useless if_


_they patronised the new waterway, and they refused to change. Finally, they_


_sold out to Ben Holladay for $200,000. Holladay later failed and sold to the_


_Oregon Steam Navigation Co. Peoples had spent $1,000,000 on boats, docks and_


_improvements during its time.&quot;_


_Have found no records linking the name of Capt. Lewis Love with this project_


_at Oregon City, however, in view of the authenticity of so many of the state-_


_ments made in the manuscript, it might well be presumed there is more truth_


_than fiction connected with his participation in the breakwater, basin and_


_freight shoot at Oregon City, particularly when we bear in mind that many_


_records have been lost in courthouse fires - and otherwise destroyed;_


_(to mention a few: Oregon City, Vancouver, Kalama, Yakima, Bend, Dallas,_


_Tillamook, and not overlooking our State Capitol Building at Salem. Then,_


_too, the freedom with which the public has been allowed access to our court-_


_house records, to the axtent that it has been quite possible for changes to_


_be made in thems and no trick whatever to walk away with complete files. I_


_have been told by two people interested in collecting historical data that_


_they have been approached by someone with official courthouse records &quot;for_


_sale&quot;, Neither of these gentlemen, however, cared to have such material in_


_their possession. An experience of my own: In asking if I might have a_


_photostet of a map that interested me and which was contained in a lawsuit_


_in which I was interested, was told by the young lady in attendance, “Why, I_


_think they might be glad to let you have this map; you know, we have to get_


_rid of a lot of this old material anyhow.&quot; Fortunately, however, when she_


_asked someone with more authority than herself if I might have the map the_


_file contained, it was decided that they would have @ photostat made for me.)_

_dence as 206 Market Street, so no doubt at the time he wrote the manuscript_


_(1899) he had started to build the residence on Market St, » Where he died on_


_July 3, 1903. The Oregonian of July 8, 1903, carried the following article:_


_“Another of Oregon&#39;s pioneers was laid to rest yesterday afternoon. The funeral_


_services of Captain Lewis Love took place in the undertaking parlors of J. P._


_Finley &amp; Son yesterday afternoon at 2:00 o&#39;clock. Rev. G. C. Cressey of the_


_First Unitarian Church performed the last sad rites, the regular Unitarian_


_funeral services being carried out._


_Many beautiful floral pieces, as well as an abundance of other flowers were_


_brought to the chapel by relatives and friends, and scented the chapel with_


_their fragrance. The remains were laid to rest in a magnificent half-couch_


_casket, and the aged pioneer was shrouded in flowers. ‘Twenty-eight carriages_


_were necessary to convey the relatives and immediate friends of Captain Love_


_to the Love cemetery, where interment took place._


_The funeral cortege was led by Dr. G. C. Cressey and funeral director A. L._


_Finley, both gentlemen riding in Captain Love&#39;s phaeton and driving his favor-_


_ite horse according to his request. At the grave the burial ceremonies were_


_simple, but impressive. When the casket was lowered to the grave the improved_


_lowering device was used, creating a beautiful effect as the coffin, covered_


_with flowers, was noiselessly placed in the grave._


_The honorary pallbearers were: T. A. Davey, D. He. Mendes, R. S, Selvy, Dr. 0._</code></pre>
<p><em>P, Plummer, J. M. McMillen, and R. Mendenhall. The active pallbearers were:</em></p>
<pre><code>_John Mock, Philo Holbrook, M. 6, Breeden, P. J. Mann, D. J. Buckley and Sylvester_


_Farrell.&quot;_


_(Captain Love is buried in whet is now Columbian Cemetery. ‘This was originally_


_a 3eacre piece of land which he set aside primarily for a family burial ground._


_He claimed that he was misused on his family right when it was declared an open_


_cemetery, al] of which displeased him and resulted in his being buried in a_


_spot just outside the cemetery. The grave of Lewis and Nancy Love can be seen_


_today just beyond the Northwest corner of the original cemetery.)_


_Details in connection with this statement have taken up considerable space in_


_several courthouses of the area, as well as newspapers._

_For the interesting history behind the towns of Parkers Landing and Washougal_


_the following chronological articles will serve as a memory refresher of the_


_participation of Capt. Love in the history of the area:_


_1877 = June 21, Vancouver Independent:_


_&quot;EDITOR INDEPENDENT: After reading the many compliments that have been paid_


_the city of LaCentre (stolen, I suppose, from someone who had taken up the pen_


_to write the far-famed history of Parkersville) I will take the responsibility_


_to give you an idea of this place. Parkersville is situated on the Columbia_


_River about 16 miles from Vancouver, near the mouth of the Big Washougal; and_


_is the trading post of Fern Prairie, Bear Prairie and Cape Horn. We have at_


_present two steamboats running opposition - the Gazelle and Calliope. They_


_make 2 trips a week, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Those long-wished-for gentlemen,_


_Messrs. Carpenter &amp; Co. of Portland have at length arrived. They have put up a_


_neat storehouse, in which they opened a new stock of goods on Monday, June \th._


_They will sell goods and buy country produce. We feel confident that they are_


_honest businessmen. This portion of the country, from whence your correspondent_


_writes, is settling very fast and in the course of a few years it will rank with_


_the leading points in Clarke County. Quite an amount of new land has been seeded_


_this year, which promises well. Crops in general look well in this vicinity.&quot;_


_1877 - June 28, Vancouver Independent:_


_&quot;Rival excursions passed up the river Wednesday morning on the Gazelle and Cal-_


_liope, the latter boat carrying passengers free.&quot;_


_1877 - July 5, Vancouver Independent:_


_“MILL PLAIN 8.8. EXCURSION: On the 27th of June the Mill Plain Sunday School_


_went on an excursion up the Columbia to Mr. J. Lateral&#39;s, The Steamer Calliope,_


_through the kindness and generosity of Capt. Love, was placed at the service of_


_the school, free of charge. The boat tock on passengers at Hexter&#39;s, Fisher&#39;s_


_Landing and Parkersville, and the company numbered 106. The day was very_


_pleasant and all enjoyed themselves in the highest degree. Capt. Love has the_


_heartfelt thanks of all those people, who will kindly remember his generosity.&quot;_


_1877 - July 12, Vancouver Independent:_


_&quot;THE FOURTH AT FISHER&#39;S LANDING: Although the clouds threatened rain in the_


_morning, a large number of people from every direction congregated at the place_


_chosen for the celebration. The steamers Calliope and Gazelle brought passengers_


_from below and above. Mr. Kelly, marshal of the day, arranged them in a line and_


_marched to a pleasant grove where was a stand over which floated our stars and_


_stripes. Nature favored all with a most beautiful day, cool and bright. G. W._


_Jones, Esq. introduced Mr. Wilson Knight who read the famous document in a very_


_creditable style, after which H. C. Lieser delivered an oration which contained_


_sentiments appropriate to the occasion. Etc. etce.cse”_


_1877 - Aug. 2, Vancouver Independent:_


_&quot;Capt. Love informs us he has put a new boiler in his boat that will stand any_


_test. He is now preparing to compete for the trade of Clarke County and the Co-_


_lumbia. The Gazelle is making her trips as usual and doing a good business.&quot;_


_1877 - Sept. 27, Vancouver Independent:_


_&quot;Destructive Fire: Last Monday evening several people of this city noticed a_


_bright light up the Columbia, about six miles distant from this place, which_


_could not at first be accounted for. The following morning news came that_


_Love&#39;s mill had been burned to the ground. The mill was kept running until_


_9 o&#39;clock Monday evening, when it was shut down and all the lights extinguished;_


_they had no fires about the building except oil lamps. A man passed the mill_


_in a skiff about 9:30 P.M., but no light was seen. The mil] was discovered to_


_be on fire about 11 o&#39;clock and it had then gained but little headway, The_


_flames soon spread to the sawmill, which stood adjacent to the grist mill, and_


_it, too, was consigned to ashes. A barn which stood about 200 yards away was,_


_with very hard work, saved from fire. J. G. Addison had rented a half interest_


_in the mill and it was doing a good business. Everything about the mills was_


_consumed, together with several hundred bushels of wheat, fifty barrels of flour_


_and a large quantity of toll grain. The property was valued at §6000 and was_


_not insured, which is a heavy loss to Capt. Love. The conflagration is supposed_


_to be the work of an incendiary.&quot; (new flour mill built by Capt. Love in 1895;_


_sawmill was not replaced)_


_1878 - March 28, Vancouver Independent:_


_&quot;The Calliope took a cargo of new barrels from Rooster Rock last Saturday.&quot;_


_1878 - Aug. 8, Vancouver Independent:_


_&quot;J. T. Stoops, purser of the Calliope has been in Portland sick from typhoid_


_fever for the last five weeks.&quot;_


_“The Gazelle drew off of Parker&#39;s Landing route.&quot;_


_1878 - Aug. 22, Vancouver Independent:_


_&quot;Steamer Gazelle appeared at the Vancouver landing on Tuesday morning on its_


_first trip out since its recent ‘unpleasantness&#39;. This steamer has resumed_


_Portland and Parker&#39;s Landing route, running on alternate days with the Cal-_


_liope. And thus Parker&#39;s Landing will have a daily boat besides the O.S.N._


_Co.&#39;s steamer.&quot;_


_1878 - Sept. 5, Vancouver Independent:_


_&quot;Capt. Love enters competition on the Vancouver-Portland steamboat route. Oppo-_


_sition Line. The Portland Standard is responsible for the statement that Capt._


_Love&#39;s new boat is almost completed and is receiving the finishing touches at_


_Smith&#39;s sawmill on the river front in the upper part of the city. We hear it_


_stated that she will be put on the Portland-Vancouver route in opposition to the_


_Vancouver Transportation Company&#39;s line, which for several years has enjoyed a_


_monopoly of the trade, which is not of sufficient importance to maintain two_


_lines&quot; The Portland Bee says that Capt. Love&#39;s new steamer when completed will_


_take the place of the Calliope, hence to Parker&#39;s Landing, Rooster Rock, Cape_


_Horn, and other points on the route._


_From newspaper clipping (undated):_


_&quot;There is to be a stiff opposition on the Columbia River between Portland and_


_the Washougal the coming summer. Mr. Lewis Love has put his commodious steamer_


_on the line. Business has increased wonderfully the past two years. Grangers_


_are at the bottom of it.&quot; Another item: “Parties in Portland have purchased_


_lots in Parkersville convenient to the river, for the purpose of building a new_


_store and cannery for canning salmon and beef.&quot; Another item: “Hon. C. T. Stiles_


_is not only pressing 160 pounds of cheese per day but occasionally takes a stroll_


_on the river bottoms and slays the geese and ducks which are plentifulé&quot; An-_


_other item: &quot;Mr. Allen of Cape Horn Mt. and Mr. Daryman of Parkersville, who_


_have been away hunting new homes in Calif. and the upper country have returned to_


_their families of the opinion that &quot;There is no place like home&quot;. They think_


_their farms are more valuable than they were last fall.&quot;_


_March 1880 -  Lewis Love sold interest in Traveler to D. Makes._


_1880 - April 15, Vancouver Independent:_


_&quot;A number of farmers and others from Parker&#39;s Landing were in Vancouver Tuesday_


_perfecting arrangements to remove the town of Washougal to a new location - 14_


_miles above Parker&#39;s Landing - where a new village will be started immediately._


_About $2000 has been subscribed to mild a wharf. Difficulty about land titles_


_at the old landing is the cause of this new movement, so we understand.&quot;_


_Another article (date?) from Vancouver library:_


_&quot;About 14 miles above Parkersville and three miles above LaCamas stands the town_


_of Washougal. This place makes a very pretty appearance as viewed from the river._


_The houses are all newly painted and the gardens are kept neat and clean. The_


_town was laid eut about six years ago on a plat of about 20 acres secured from_


_Mr. Ough by J. E. C. Durgan and Lewis Love. It now has a population of 150 people._


_Its business consists of two general merchandise stores, a hotel with a bar room_


_attachment. The firm of Gary &amp; Hertzig occupy a fine building and carry quite a_


_complete line of merchandise. H. H. Carpenter also carries a good stock of_


_general merchandise.......F¥rits Braun is proprietor of the hotel. The Congre-_


_gational Denomination have built a neat little church where services are held on_


_two Sundays of each month. Washougal is situated in the midst of a rich agri-_


_cultural district and, it seems to us, must sometime be a place of considerable_


_importance.&quot;_


_1880 - Vancouver Independent:_


_&quot;The town plat is completed and legalized and only one building is up for a starter,_


_put up by A. H. Kersey for a residence. J. E. C. Durgan will erect a building_


_for his store which he will move up there this month if possible. As he is the_


_new postmaster the Washougal office goes to the new town. It is said the new lo-_


_cation will be nearer and more convenient for a large number of settlers who_


_have to go to that office for their mail.&quot;_

<p>Before we recount at least some of the events reported in the Love Manuscript I include a clip from Henry Hall’s “<em>America’s Successful Men of Affairs</em>” (Hall, 1896). It gives a short summary of the early history and adventures of Lewis Love, although the account of the encounter with the Cherokees should perhaps be taken with several grains of salt.</p>

<p>It is tempting to go over the Manuscript and summarize the travels of husband, wife, and five children over the plains, crossing rivers and climbing mountains. But we are mostly interested in what happened after Lewis Love arrived in Oregon and settled on the Columbia Slough.</p>

<p>We start with the 1852 survey map. Where the road to Vancouver meets the path that is now Columbia Boulevard we see Captain Love’s house, in the northeast corner of the intersection.</p>
<p>At that time it was the only house in what is now the Piedmont neighborhood. There seemed to have been basically two roads or paths from Portland to Vancouver. The main one is the County Road and there is a secondary path, which is probably older. Love built his house next to the county road, and John Rankin built his house half a mile to the west, closer to the old path. On the cutout below we see the two houses (as black dots) in rectangle gray areas that indicate improved farm lands.</p>

<p>There is an interesting article in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B94Urj3OjM7BcWJwbVQxWWRHbHM">Morning Oregonian of April 26, 1897</a>. It is an interview with Lewis Love about the period, in 1852-1853.</p>
<pre><code>_Captain Love built and occupied the first house on the main road between Portland and Vancouver. It was he who ran that road through to the Columbia Slough, and he was supervisor of the road for a long time._</code></pre>
<p>And:</p>
<pre><code>_I moved away in 1855 and rented my home there to John Rankin, who had built a house two years after our arrival, about half a mile west and off the road._</code></pre>
<p>There is another interview in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NEcz9E-OI6LKM-lo7zxBkke9B0SL38zf">Morning Oregonian of December 4, 1900</a>, under the inviting title “<em>Mr. Love’s Stories</em>”.</p>
<pre><code>_When Mr. Love started to farm on Columbia Slough Indian dances were frequent. Portland was undreamt of._</code></pre>
<p>I somehow doubt the indian dances part. The interview goes on about how Lewis Love got into logging.</p>
<pre><code>_It was costing me a great deal to burn up my timber while clearing. I decided to try rafting to Portland. I put about 20,000 logs in the stream during high water in the Winter of 1852. I then built upright posts and yards on one end of the raft and sailed to Portland. A good strong breeze carried us up the river. We made the trip in about four hours. Another time I came near being caught in a pinch on a contract to deliver logs to the mills in Portland. The water dropped down and a strong current was running in the river. We had to work our way up from the head of the Sauvies Island Slough by an improvised capstan, or windlass, the end of the rope being attached to any convenient object along the shore while the windlass was worked taking up the coil of rope. If I remember rightly we were 16 days getting to the city._</code></pre>
<p>Multnomah County did not exist until December 22, 1854. Before that we were in Clackamas County. In 1851 Lewis Love obtained a licence from Clackamas County to operate a ferry across Columbia Slough, on the road towards the ferry across the Columbia River operated by John Switzler (Query, 2008, p. 54). Here is some more detail, including rates.</p>

<p>The Love Manuscript has considerable detail about the ferries, timber transports, sawmills, grid mills, hotels, grocery stores, and steam ships run by Lewis Love over the years. Although his businesses quite often either flooded or burnt down he made a lot of money, and was generally considered to be a millionaire around 1900.</p>

<p>Lewis Love, about 80 years old</p>
<p>Lewis Love had a large and complicated family. His children were in the habit of marrying multiple times, and having many children in each marriage. Thus there are also a lot of partners and stepchildren around. There were also some adopted children. In order to keep track I used the MacFamilyTree software. The link below points to a website where you can click your way through (my current version of) the Love family tree.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.macfamilytree.com/deleeuw/Love%20Family%20Tree/languages/en/index.html">https://www.macfamilytree.com/deleeuw/Love%20Family%20Tree/languages/en/index.html</a></p>
<p>It uses information from many genealogical sources, mostly found on ancestry.com, but also from census information and newspaper articles. The genealogical sources sometimes contradict each other, are often quite incomplete, and contain various errors, but hopefully the errors average out. One error, for example, is that the tree says William Ulysses Love, the oldest son, was born in October 1838 and Jeremiah Joye, the second son, in December 1838. This seems unlikely. Like the rest of this book, the tree is a work in progress. As new information becomes available, it is added. I did limit myself, for obvious reasons, to including children and grandchildren, with their partners. No great-grandchildren, with the exception of Hazel Viola King, because she appears in the will of Lewis Love. Partners of the Love sons and daughters often had previous marriages, and children from those previous marriages. And these children were usually adopted into their new Love families. But they are not included here, because I did not want to follow the various “<em>partners of partners</em>” branches of the tree.</p>
<p>Although the web page linked above is the easiest way to follow the descendants, I also include a chart with a global view of the tree. It is unreadable as such, but the URL below it links to a pdf that you can download and enlarge as much as you want.</p>

<p>Time for a nice anecdote. Unlike his many children Lewis Love only married once. This is despite the efforts of Mrs. L. E. Wetmore, one year after Nancy died. In the Oregonian of August 3, 1893 we see:</p>

<p>One way to follow the family through time is to look at successive federal census records. This shows where the family lived, which children lived at home, and what the current occupations were. We start in 1840, while the Love family resided in DeKalb, Illinois. The census form is somewhat unclear, and ancestry.com has it under the name Towers Jone, but after deciphering it we see two free white male persons younger than five (sons William and Jeremiah), one free white male person between 20 and 30 (Lewis) and one free white female person between 20 and 30 (Nancy). Of these one person is in the category “<em>working in agriculture</em>” and one in “<em>insane and idiots in public charge</em>”. This harsh label may refer to Jeremiah, who died when four years old in 1842.</p>

<p>We know that between 1840 and 1850 the family moved west to Oregon. In 1850 the family arrived on the Columbia Slough and Lewis Love built a home on the northeast corner at the intersection of the Vancouver road and the Slough road (now Columbia Boulevard). They moved from that location in 1855. In the 1860 census the family is in Clark County in Washington Territory. Lewis Love, 42 years old, is a lumber miller. He was already well to do. His real estate holdings were worth about $ 25,000, his personal property was about $ 15,000. His three sons Fred (13), Green (11) and Lewis (9) were living at home. William (married in 1854), Malinda (married in 1856) and Mary (married in 1856) had already moved out.</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LUdsRd1OIaaGQv_WTJAepLopJy5i5b4v">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LUdsRd1OIaaGQv_WTJAepLopJy5i5b4v</a></p>

<p>In 1870 Lewis was a sawyer in a saw mill, still living in Clark County. He now owned $ 46,000 in real estate and $ 12,000 in personal property. Green (21, now a laborer), Lewis (18), and Mary (11) were living at home. I am not sure which Mary this was, it definitely is not his daughter. It could be Mary Ann Ennis, later Mary A. Love, married to Fred in 1876 when she was 19.</p>

<p>In the 1880 census Lewis was a steamboat captain, living on 326 First Street in Portland. Green C., a 30 year old steam boat engineer, was the only child still living at home, with his wife Louise C. (age 26), and with three granddaughters Katie L. (age 5), Martha G. (age 2), and Bella R. and with two grandsons Joseph (age 7 months) and Fred D. (age 9). Katie, Martha, and Joseph have a mother born in Oregon, presumably Louise, and Bella and Fred have a mother born in Michigan, which indicates their father is Fred and their mother is Ada Loomis.</p>

<p>A more precise picture arises from the Portland City Directories. I list the various Love’s that are mentioned in each year for which we have information. Because there is a rapidly increasing number of Love family members over the years, I limit myself to Lewis and Nancy and the children and their partners. I also give the addresses and the professions, when available in the directory. For reference: an “<em>expressman</em>” refers to anyone who has the duty of packing, managing, and ensuring the delivery of any cargo.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Death</h2>
<p>On Friday, July 3 1903 at 7.40 AM Captain Lewis Love died of heart failure at his house on 206 Market Street. He was 85 years old. To put this in perspective, life expectancy in the US in 1903 was about 50 years, so 85 was really old. Here is his obituary from the Oregon Daily Journal.</p>

<p>As our next section in this chapter, on the will and testament, shows, the only piece of land that Lewis Love ever deeded away were the 7 acres for the Columbia Cemetery, originally named Love Cemetery. It was intended for him and his family, but at some point regulations required it to become a general cemetery, to the lasting displeasure of Captain Love. He thus proceeded to reserve another strip of land bordering the Columbia Cemetery, in the northwest corner, just big enough for the graves of him and Nancy. And that was where he was buried on July 7, 1903.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.7</span> The Will</h2>
<p>On January 5, 1899 Lewis Love made his final will and testament, which I will (reluctantly) retype in full. It has a useful list of the real property owned and it lists all the heirs. It shows how careful Lewis Love was to make sure this document was known to be his real and only will. As the end of the Manuscript indicates, he had to deal with forged wills and with challenges of his wife’s will after she died. The will also indicates that in all the years he never sold any real estate, he only bought more. The parcels in sections 10, 11, 14, and 16 were 640 acres at the time of the donation land claim, and they were 757 acres at the time of the testament, mostly by extending the original DLC to the west and to the north over the Slough, by buying parts of the Switzler DLC up to Force’s Lake.</p>
<p>Remember that Lewis Love died in 1903. It must have been very frustrating for the heirs that they had to wait for distribution until 1907. The will, and the codicil that follows the will, have been taken from the Love v. Walker et al. lawsuit in the Oregon Supreme Court (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B94Urj3OjM7BR3VjWHJoUnNHQ2c">Pacific Reporter, 1911</a>).</p>
<pre><code>_Know all men by these presents: That I, Lewis Love, of Portland, Multnomah County, Oregon, being over the age of 80 years, and being of sound and disposing mind and memory, do make and declare this as my last will and testament, in manner and form following, that is to say: I make,  constitute and appoint T. T. Struble, Philo Holbrook and H. C. Breeden executors of this my last will and testament, and request and direct that no bonds or undertaking be required of them as such, nor of them as trustees to hold my estate to a certain time hereinafter mentioned. I direct that all of my just debts, including funeral expenses and the expenses of administration, be paid by my executors. I order that my purpose and ownership of property shall be clearly understood, I hereby preface my devises and requests as follows: I have made no deed to any person or persons to any real or personal property to take effect at or after my death. I made five deeds to my children and grandchildren September 21, 1894, which were executed and acknowledged before T. T. Struble, notary public. I made eights deeds to my children, grandchildren and grandchild December 28, 1896, which were also acknowledged before T. T. Struble, notary public, other than these mentioned deeds I have made none since the first mentioned ones of September 21, 1894. I am the owner absolute of the following real property in the city of Portland, Oregon: Lots 1 and 2, block 177, city; lot 4, block 116, city; lot 3, block 10, city; north half lot 2, block 10, city; lot 8, block 11, city; south half of lot 2, block 4, city; the est 75 feet and 11 inches of the south half of lot 4, block 3, city; the north half of lot 4, block 3, city; the south half of lot 3, block 3, city. I have never made a deed to any person or persons of any part or piece of this property whatever. I also own 757 acres, more or less, of land in sections 10, 11, 14, and 15, township 1 north, range 1 east, Willamette meridian; a portion of this land is outside of and a portion inside the city limits of Portland, Oregon._


_I have made no deed to any of this acreage to any person or persons at any time, except for Columbia Cemetery. It is my purpose to will at this time all of my property, personal, real and mixed, to my legal heirs in the same proportion as the law would convey the same to them in the absence of any will by me, reserving only the burial place where my wife is now buried, and a strip of land two feet in width adjacent thereto on the west, north and east of said burial spot, and I hereby set aside said burial place (spot) and said two feet of land adjacent thereto forever as a resting place or burial spot for my wife and myself; said burial place joins Columbia Cemetery on the northwest corner, which said cemetery is in section 10, township 1 north, range 1 east, Willamette meridian._


_My will is and I direct that my estate shall be divided into six (6) shares or parts of equal value, to be disposed of in the following manner, viz: First. I give, devise and bequeath to my son, Fred D. Love, one of said shares or parts. Second. I give, devise and bequeath to my son, Green C. Love, one of said shares or parts. Third. I give, devise and bequeath to my son, Lewis P. Love, one of said shares or parts. Fourth. I give, devise and bequeath to my grandson, William King, a son of my deceased daughter Malinda J. Sheperd, one-third part of one of said shares or parts. Fifth. I give, devise and bequeath to my granddaughter, Matilda Sheperd, wife of James Shepard, and a daughter of my deceased daughter Malinda J. Sheperd, one-third part of one of said shares or parts.  Sixth. I give, devise and bequeath to my great-granddaughter, Hazel King, who is a minor child, and a daughter of Albion King, deceased, who is a son of my deceased daughter Malinda J. Sheperd, one-third part of one of said shares or parts. Seventh. I give, devise and bequeath to my daughter, Mary C. Stafford, one of said shares or parts. Eighth. I give, devise and bequeath to the children of my deceased son, William Love, one of said shares or parts of my estate to be divided among said children as follows: To L.W. Love, the one-fifth part of said share; to John A. Love, the one-fifth part of said share; to Ulysses G. Love, the one-fifth part of said share; to Charles W. Love, the one-fifth part of said share; to Frank P. Love, the one-fifth part of said share._


_It is my will and purpose that my estate shall be kept intact and not distributed to my devisees till January 1, 1907 (nineteen hundred and seven). I direct that my executors shall proceed to administer upon my estate at once after my demise, and having in due time closed up my estate as executors, that then my estate shall pass to them as trustees, to be held in trust for my said devisees till January 1, 1907, and managed by them as such trustees until the time of final distribution. I direct that my trustees, T. T. Struble, Philo Holbrook and H. C. Breeden, from time to time as the receipts of my estate may exceed the expenditures, such portion thereof as in the judgment of my said trustees can safely be distributed and paid to the devisees pro rata, not oftener than two times in each twelve months. I direct that my trustees make final distribution of my estate on January 1, 1907, or as soon thereafter as practicable, and if my devisees can agree, said final distribution can be by division of my property by such agreement, but if they cannot so agree, the my trustees shall make a division of my property according to the shares and parts of shares in my estate and my devisees can cast lots for their several interests either in person or by their lawful representatives. Be it remembered, however, that in the administration of my estate by my executors, and before they close up my estate, and it passes to them as trustees, all personal property is to be sold, and the proceeds of such sale will belong to and become a part of my estate._


_In their trust my trustees are hereby empowered to rent property and collect rents, make necessary repairs to property, pay taxes, or to be more explicit, they are empowered hereby to collectively do all acts that I could do were I living, necessary tp protect and keep my estate intact for my devisees hereinbefore mentioned. Should a vacancy occur in my trustees, then the remaining ones or one are to act and carry out this trust. This is my only will, but I now refer to a canceled will made by me April 13, 1896, for the purpose of corroborating the idea that it was always my purpose to distribute my property equally between my several children and to the heirs of those of my children who had died, leaving children or grandchildren._


_Be it remembered that reference to said canceled will shall not make it a part of this will, but only show what my intentions have always been toward my heirs. Reference to the fact in this will that I am the owner of and have made no deed to certain property, is because I have been informed, reliably, of one fraudulent deed to certain valuable property purporting to have been made by me and also have heard rumours of the existence of another fraudulent deed. I pronounce and declare alls such deeds or deed as fraudulent; and any and all claims of any person or persons of having genuine deeds or titles to any of the property hereinbefore described, are false and villainous, and I hereby instruct my executors and trustees to context any such claims to the uttermost, that my property may be kept intact and saved to my lawful heirs as herein devised. And lastly, I do hereby revoke all other wills heretofore made by me, and declare this and no other to be my last will and testament, and desire that of this proof shall be taken and admitted to probate as a muniment of title._


_In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 5th day of January, 1899. _


_[Signed] Lewis Love [Seal]_</code></pre>
<p>So a short summary of the distribution of the estate is:</p>
<p>⅙ to Fred D. Love</p>
<p>⅙ to Green C. Love</p>
<p>⅙ to Lewis P. Love</p>
<p>⅙ to Mary C. Stafford</p>
<p>⅙ to children of Malinda J. Sheperd (†)</p>
<ul>
<li>William King</li>
<li>Matilde Sheperd</li>
<li>Albion King (†) - Hazel King</li>
</ul>
<p>⅙ to children of William Love (†)</p>
<ul>
<li>Lewis W. Love</li>
<li>John A. Love</li>
<li>Ulysses G. Love</li>
<li>Charles W. Love</li>
<li>Frank P. Love</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, for example, Ulysses Love gets 1/30 of the estate, and Hazel King gets 1/18.</p>
<p>On February 26, 1902, Lewis Love added a codicil to his will, and one that caused a great deal of consternation and a long-lasting lawsuit after his death.</p>
<pre><code>_I, Lewis Love of Portland, Oregon, do make this codicil to my will. I hereby expressly confirm my last will, dated January 5, 1899, excepting in so far as the distribution of my property is changed by this codicil. First. I hereby will, decree and declare that the devise or legacy to my daughter, Mary C. Stafford in my said will, shall be for her sole and separate use, independent of her husband at all times, and that at her death the said devise or legacy to her shall go to her children, share and share alike. Second. I hereby will, decree and declare that the devise or legacy, in my said will, to my son, Fred D. Love, shall be for his sole and separate use, independent of his wife at all times, and that at his death the said devise or legacy to him shall go to his children, share and share alike. Third. Second. I hereby will, decree and declare that the devise or legacy in my said will to my son, Green C. Love shall be for his sole and separate use, independent of his wife at all times, and that in case of his death without lawful issue, born alive and living at the time of his death, then the said devise or legacy to him shall belong and go to the remaining devisees of my said will in proportion as they hold of the shares or parts of my said will. Lastly. I declare this is a codicil to my will, and that this is the only codicil that I have made, and I hereby declare my said will of date January 5, 1899, to be my last will and testament and also hereby re-affirm the same in every particular, except a modified by this codicil, which codicil is to be attached to the sad will. Witness my hand and sea this 26th day of February, 1902. [Signed] Lewis Love. [Seal.]_</code></pre>
<p>The codicil does two things. It protects the estate against the scheming husbands and wives of Mary, Fred, and Green and makes sure the property only travels in a straight genealogical line, without reverting to inlaws and other deplorables. In the second place it singles out Green C. Love, who was married in 1876 and had five children. In 1896, however, both his wife and all his children had died. He remarried in 1901 with a bride he had found through a personal ad, which was a method and a resulting bride the Captain did not approve of. So again the special provision had be added to the codicil to make sure the property did not go to outsiders. As we shall see this codicil resulted in lawsuits and court proceedings that lasted more than ten years. More about this later in this chapter.</p>

<p>Lewis P. Love, Green C. Love, Fred D. Love</p>
<p>William Love was the oldest son. As we have seen, he died in 1879. The next two sons were Jeremiah, who lived from 1838 until 1842, and Joseph, who lived from 1845 until 1862. I know very little about Jeremiah and Joseph. The manuscript of Captain Lewis Love says that three of his sons drowned, but it only mentions William by name as one of them. So I assume that both Jeremiah and Joseph drowned. Note that Jeremiah died before the family moved to Oregon.</p>
<div id="william-love-the-dairy-man" class="section level3" number="4.9.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.9.1</span> William Love: The Dairy Man</h3>
<p>The oldest son, William Ulysses Love, was born in 1838 in Missouri. He traveled with his parents to Oregon in 1849. He first married Temperance Shaver on November 2, 1854, who died March 1, 1858 after giving birth to two children, and then on March 10, 1859 he married 14 year old Sarah Catherine Windle, with whom he had an additional seven children. Here is a URL linking to his part of the Love family tree.</p>

<p>In the 1870’s William Love ran a successful dairy business from his home on the Columbia Slough. In the Oregonian of September 1871 we find advertisements for that business.</p>

<p>Even earlier, in 1860 when he was still in his early twenties, William Love acquired a parcel of land of more than 150 acres. I do not know where he got the more than one thousand dollars to pay for it, but let’s review the parcel we are talking about.</p>
<p>On March 10, 1866 the United States registered a military warrant for 160 acres to Charles Vincent, for his service in Private Company H, 2nd Regiment of U.S. Dragoons, in some so-called Apache Indian Disturbance. Charles Vincent immediately transferred the land to Robert S. Maxey. Here is the patent.</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OUOOb58IKpdXVW8GebZXacBx45Y_f0dw">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OUOOb58IKpdXVW8GebZXacBx45Y_f0dw</a></p>
<p>The precise description of the land is</p>
<pre><code>_The fractional South East quarter of Section Nine and the Fractional South West quarter of Section Ten in Township One North of Range One East in the District of lands subject to sale at Oregon City, Oregon, containing one hundred and Fifty two acres and one hundredth of an acre._</code></pre>
<p>In terms of modern streets, the land is bounded by Kilpatrick to the north, Lombard to the south, the I-5 to the east, and (approximately) Delaware to the west. In other words, a large chunk of current Kenton. On December 28, 1860 Robert S. Maxey sold the 152.01 acres to William Love for one thousand and twenty five dollars.</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1d0DwA318z6u_lHuJCiMru_CyE84ScvE-">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1d0DwA318z6u_lHuJCiMru_CyE84ScvE-</a></p>
<p>The dates on the deed are interesting. The Military Donation act was passed in 1855, and presumably Charles Vincent claimed his donation shortly after that. Then Robert Maxey sold to William Love in 1860, even though the official warrant was not issued until 1866. If we go over the various homesteads and donation land grants mentioned in this book we see that many of the warrants and patents were not registered until 1866. This delay is not unusual, as Vaughan (2014, p. 45) explains.</p>
<pre><code>_The GLO district land offices were required to certify entitlement to a land patent by issuance of a final certificate upon satisfaction of all statutory requirements by the entryman or purchaser._</code></pre>
<p>And the year 1866 is of special significance. Again from Vaughan (2014, p. 45)</p>
<pre><code>_The issuance of land patents was greatly curtailed during the turbulent Civil War years of 1861 to 1865 – delaying most donation land claim patents until after the war._ </code></pre>
<p>In the case of the Maxey-Love transaction there was even more delay. The deed was signed in 1860 in the County of Clark, Territory of Washington, in the presence of William Kelly, Clerk of the District Court. Mr. Kelly basically notarized the signing of the deed, using an oath by a Mr. John Hexler that the person who appeared before him was indeed Robert Maxey. This may not have been enough to actually file the deed with Multnomah County, and in 1877 Roger Greene, associate justice of the Washington Supreme Court, testified that William Kelly was indeed a clerk at that time, and that the laws of Washington authorized him to notarize the deed. In addition, in 1882, a Mr. McConnell, the current clerk and record keeper for the district court, testified that William Kelly was who he said he was, and that his signature was indeed his true signature. So this was 22 years after the original signing. Moreover, as we shall see, it was three years after the death of William Love.</p>
<p>Over the years, William Love became a thriving and well-respected citizen. In the 1870 census the family lived in the Willamette Precinct with six children and two laborers. In 1875 William was appointed Supervisor of Multnomah County road district 3. In 1876 he was appointed Judge of Elections in the Willamette District. He also served on the school board for the district. But all was not well. Below are two articles from the Morning Oregonian, the first from February 12, 1879 and the second from the next day, and one from the Willamette Farmer of February 14. William Love committed suicide by drowning himself in the Columbia Slough. “… he had rid himself of his bodily ills by casting himself into the river.”_ _There is obviously no clear diagnosis of his ailment in these articles from 1879, but the officiating clergyman mentioned that “a protracted illness of nearly two years, accompanied by occasional paroxysms of internal distress, had so far unbalanced his mind as to constitute him periodically insane.”</p>

<p>William died on February 11, 1879. One week later, on February 17, his father Lewis Love was appointed as administrator of the estate. For those who are really interested, here is a link to the 143-page probate file from the Multnomah County Court.</p>

<p>As is usually the case with probate files, it is a genuine treasure trove of information. It has appraisals and descriptions of personal and real property, receipts for various transactions, debts of the estate, letters, court orders, and much more. I will include copies of some of the pages, with some comments. First, there is a nice description of the real property.</p>

<p>This is still the original Robert Maxey DLC. Ulery et al valued the land at $ 2,500. Lewis Love asked permission of the court to sell the land by auction in three pieces: the western half, the western half of the eastern half, and the eastern half of the eastern half. And this is exactly what happened. On February 11, 1882 the western half was sold to William Showers, sheriff of Multnomah County, for $ 1,634.10. At the same auction the western half of the eastern half was sold to Charles Sitton for $ 798.04. It seems that something was wrong with the Showers transaction. On May 15, 1882 there was a second auction, where Joseph Buchtel, sheriff of Multnomah County, bought the western half for $ 3,192.20. The eastern half of the eastern half, which was the part where William Love had his house and business, and the part adjoining the Lewis Love DLC, was not sold, at least not yet.</p>

<p>Here is the final account of the administrator. We see the land sales, totalling $ 3,192.20 + $ 798.04 = $ 3,990.24. There are other items on the “money received” side that are interesting. There were 670 cords of wood, appraised at $ 700. There were 500 bushels of potatoes, appraised at 60 cents a bushel. They had to be sold rather quickly, otherwise they would sprout. There were six adult cows, appraised at $ 25 per cow, 3 two-year old cows at $ 15, and 3 one-year old cows at $ 7.50. On the “money paid” side we see more than $ 250 paid to neighbor John Hotts, who plays a role in many of the chapters of this book. The $ 408 paid to Antoine Masley was the balance for “work and labor” performed at the request of William Love during the years 1875-1879, at a salary of $ 30 per month. We also see $ 643.98 paid to the Oregon and Washington Trust and Investment Company. This is for a mortgage of originally $ 600 on his land that William Love got in 1877. The biannual payments were about $ 77, and these payments were three years in arrears in 1882. The balance of the account was distributed to Sarah Love and her six sons (or to their guardians, if they were still minors in 1882). Each of them got $ 371.53. There were only six sons left, because William Albert Love died in 1880, at the age of twenty. The administrator Lewis Love received $ 216.90.</p>
<p>Sarah Love continued to live on the homestead until 1897. Then she died.</p>

<p>The rest of the estate is wood, fruit, and cows. The heirs are John Anderson Love, Ulysses Grant Love, Charles Walter Love, and Franklin Pierce Love. There were only four sons left, because William Albert Love died in 1880 and Phylip Clayborn Love died in 1892. Although Lewis Washington Love was still very much alive he did not appear in the list of heirs, possibly because he was a son from William Love’s first marriage.</p>

<p>Malinda J. Love and Richard N. Sheperd</p>
<p>Malinda June Love (sometimes Melinda June) was the oldest daughter. She was born in Missouri in 1841. I know very little about her, presumably because her career was “keeping house”. She married three times, the first time in 1856, when she was 15. Her first husband was John P. King, a farmer and general utility man located in Benton County, in the Corvallis area. He was born in 1835 in Iowa and came to Oregon in 1853. His OHS archive card tells us he was a socialist. Good for him. In the 1860 census the couple lived in Corvallis, and they had a one year old son Theodore. In 1870 Malinda lived with Theodore and eight year old Albion and three year old William in Clark County, Territory of Washington. Both Albion and William were born in Washington, but there is no John P. King on the census form any more. In 1880 we do find John P. King, a carpenter, and Theodore King, now a 21 year old mail carrier, in the lovely-named city of Philomath, close to Corvallis.</p>
<p>Malinda’s second marriage in 1977 was to Jackson Crouch, owner of the Crouch &amp; Reed commission feed store in Portland.</p>

<p>Mary C. Love and Nathan Stafford</p>
<p>Mary C. Love was born in Missouri on April 25, 1842. She crossed the plains with her parents and arrived in Multnomah in 1849. On September 14, 1856, when she was 14 years old, she married George W. Shafer (or Schaeffer), who was 30 years old at the time, and in the grocery store business with her father. George Shaeffer died the next year, and Mary married Nathan D. Stafford in 1859, when he was 33 years old and she was 17, and already two years a widow. O tempora ! O mores !</p>
<p>From then on, we can follow Mary through the successive federal censuses and city directories and see what the composition of her household is. Around 1880 she is listed as a nurse or midwife, while Nathan is a carpenter. In 1860 Mary has given birth to a daughter Emeline, at the census date 7 months old. In 1870 Emeline is 8, and she are joined by Leona (6), Matilda (4), and Ulysses Grant (1). In 1880 we find Ida (13), Louis G. (11), Nancy M. (9), Sarah R. (7), Delia (5), Lena (3), and Geo (2 months). There is no 1890 census, and in 1900 there are no new children, and we have Lena (22), Lewis (31), and Nellie C (34) living at home. Nathan Stafford died in 1903.</p>
<p>In the 1910 census Mary has moved in with her daughter Alice (then Alice L. Preacher) and in 1920 she lives with her other daughter Nancy (then Nancy M. Finke). She dies August 14, 1927 at 360 E. Lombard Street (now 65 NE Lombard), 85 years old. From the eulogies it seems that the surviving children are Emma J. Walker, Alsistres L. Peacher, Lewis G. Stafford, Nancy M. Finke, Sedelia P. Hohmann, all of Portland, Oregon, Sarah R. Anderson of Orchards, Washington, and Lena G. Richmond of Ardenwald, Oregon. Note that Emma is Emeline, the oldest daughter, born in 1860.</p>

<p>I have some special feelings for Mary and Nathan, because I live on Stafford Street. Snyder (1979, p 208) says</p>
<pre><code>_The original dedication of this street was in the University Park neighborhood. If, as we believe, the name was chosen by the Methodists who developed University Park, it is probably a namesake for Charles Lewis Stafford, who was president of Iowa Wesleyan University 1891-1899. _</code></pre>
<p>Nice try, but no cigar. There seems to have been a Stafford Street in South Saint John’s, which was renamed out of existence around 1908. There is a small section of Stafford Street on the border of University Park, between Woolsey and Olin, at the south line of Mock’s Addition, but it was originally called Syracuse Street, and it was renamed to Stafford Street in 1918. I do not see a Stafford Street in the original 1891 plat maps for University Park. There is one in the original plats for Loveleigh, Lovewood, and Swinton from around 1908. And then around 1910-1920 there was some additional renaming and Stafford Street came to run east from Union through Farrell’s Addition and Farrell’s Second Addition until it ran into Lombard and stopped.</p>

<p>After William died the next oldest son, and one that survived to a ripe old age, was Frederick Decatur Love. He was a colorful one. He was born in Missouri in 1847, just before the family moved west.</p>

<p>Frederick D. Love</p>
<p>I will follow him in the usual way, by using the federal census and the city directories. In the 1870 census he lives in Clark County, Washington Territory, working in his father’s saw mill. January 27, 1868 he had married Adah Louise Loomis</p>
<p>February 19, 1876 Mary Ann Ennis</p>
<p>1880 Census, Pilot Steamboat, 306 Water Street, Maggie (3), Jeremiah (8/12), Annie Morris (10), Minnie Morris (8), ??? Morris (6)</p>
<p>Initially, Fred and his father seemed to have had a fairly normal relationship. Fred worked in his father’s saw mill, and was captain on his father’s steamboats. There may have been some minor conflicts, caused by incidents such as the one reported in the Vancouver Independent of December 7, 1882.</p>

<p>But the relationship went definitely south after the death of Nancy in 1892, and at breakneck speed. The reason is probably that there were two different versions of Nancy’s wills circulating. I will discuss this in great detail in the section on the fake will in this chapter, but for now it suffices to know that in one of the wills Nancy left $ 100 to each of her sons and daughters, and the rest of the estate to Lewis Love while in the other will she left $ 100 to Lewis Love and the rest of the estate to her sons and daughters. And remember that it was the Lewis and Nancy Love Donation Land Claim, which means that legally she was the owner of 320 acres. And development had started in the area, with Good Morning Addition, Piedmont, Woodlawn, Saratoga, Lochinvar all having been platted in 1892. Captain Lewis Love was an old hand at lawsuits, and he did not take kindly to the fact that Fred Love sued him in trying to throw out the first will, favorable to Lewis, and replace it by the second will, favorable to the offspring, and thus to Fred. It seems Lewis did not take half measures, and he had Fred arrested for insanity in November 1892. From the Oregonian of July 15, 1893:</p>

<p>Ten years later there was another “son against father” case, but this time Fred was the father. The son in this case was Royal Frederick Love.</p>
<p>The “spendthrift” designations in the newspapers was party fake news. Fred inherited ⅙ of the estate, which he could use as he saw fit (after January 1907). Borrowed $ 2,000, then sold to D.J. Buckley for $ 8,600 to pay off the debt, far less than it was worth. Then spend the remainder on liquor and loose women.</p>

<p>As with Fred, it is not entirely clear to me (yet) how many times Green married, and to whom, and how many children he had. In 1872 he married Elizabeth Owen.</p>

<p>In the 1880 census he lived with his father</p>
<p>There is an interesting marriage in Clackamas County, of Green C. Love of Multnomah County and Alvina S. Hellenbrant of Multnomah County, on July 2, 1884. Here is the marriage license.</p>

<p>I am not 100% certain that this is our Green C. Love, but on the other hand, how many Green C. Love’s can there be. In any case, the marriage ended unhappily. The last name Hellenbrant of course means Hellfire, and Green accused his then bride of living up to her name. From the divorce section of the Oregonian of January 19, 1898:</p>

<p>When Nancy Love died in 1892 there was the matter of the inheritance. Remember that the Donation Land Claim of 640 acres was in the name of Lewis and Nance Love, and thus Nancy was the owner of 320 acres. By 1892 that was worth a lot of money.</p>
