## Homesteaders: Evander Howe


### Life

In the 1860s Evander Howe came from Vermont to Oregon. He does not appear even once in any of the Oregon newspapers from the time period. Eugene E. Snyder _(1989, p. 114) _says


>    _No record tells us what sort of man Evander Howe was, nor how he occupied his time in Oregon._

As I began this research it was unclear when and where he was born and how old he was when he died. There is not much information, but there is a bit more than nothing.

Snyder mentions he has no idea what Howe tried or did during his final years, or if he was even in Portland. But I found him in the 1880 census. He was enumerated on July 14, a 45 year old farmer living in the Willamette Precinct. The name was transcribed as Evanden, but the census form is pretty clear. His neighbor on the form is the 52 year old farmer John Hott (sic). That should actually be John Hotts. Both of them were single. Evander apparently lived alone, Hotts had a hired hand living at the same address. Another neighbor on the same census form is Davis Ulery (sic), a 49 year old farmer, with a large family. That should actually be David Ulery.

### Death

Snyder tells us Evander Howe died in 1882. Initially, I was not able to find the precise date of death, or the location of the grave. But there is much useful information, as is often the case, in the probate file (Case number 858, Multnomah Court Records, 56 pages).

[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xs6X_Qrkn7oQ42qUxIBs0PgluGlfWPlM](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xs6X_Qrkn7oQ42qUxIBs0PgluGlfWPlM)

As I have remarked elsewhere, probate files and cemetery records often make it easier to find out facts about a person’s death than about their life. This is partly because they arrived from different places, but they all died in Portland. Also, their birth and childhood often were lived in areas that were not yet incorporated and did not have state, county, or city administrative offices. And thirdly, there is just more bureaucratic and journalistic activity around estates and deaths than around births or marriages, partly because often the heirs tend to get into elaborate fights amongst themselves. This is, of course, especially true for large estates, because greed needs a substrate to grow on.

So what did I learn from the probate file ? Evander Howe died intestate on June 24, 1882. Thus the court had to appoint an administrator to oversee the appraisal and distribution of the estate. In order to get the job potential administrators petition the court for an appointment, usually pointing out why they were especially suited for the position. In Howe’s case there were two petitioners. The first was R. G. Rex M.D. who was “one of the principal creditors of said deceased”. Also Dr. Rex had some pertinent information. In his petition he gave the precise description of Evander’s real estate, and its estimated value of $ 8,000, and he knew of the existence of “ a brother names Estey Howe residing at or near Brattleboro in Windham County in the State of Vermont.” Nevertheless Dr. Rex lost out to Edward Holman, the funeral and cremation provider, who ran “the second oldest business in Portland”, since 1854. The business still exists. See their website at [https://www.holmansfuneralservice.com](https://www.holmansfuneralservice.com). There was a great deal of money in funerals, it seems, and Holman became a capitalist, and a very prominent citizen of Portland. Note that soon after he would actually own a half interest in Evander’s land.I don’t think Dr. Rex stood a chance, even though he knew the deceased and Holman did not. 

In his petition Holman mentioned that Evander Howe had no family in Oregon, or anywhere else, as far as he knew. But he did mention he was the principal creditor of the estate. The firm of A.P. De Lin & Co, of which he was a member, was owned $ 128.00 for funeral services. The bill in question is below. It does not say where the grave was, and I still do not know where A.P. De Lin & Co. generally disposed of the bodies.

Being an administrator required one to agree to a financial penalty if the court found the duties of the administrator were not carried out or the powers of the administrator were misused. In the Evander Howe case Holman had to agree to a penal sum of \$ 12,000. He used two sureties, Levi Anderson and councilman Sylvester Farrell, each for \$ 6,000. Note again that soon after Sylvester Farrell would own a half interest in Evander’s land.

The appraisers were D.W. Wakefield, L.L. Parrish, and T.J. Mattock. They concluded, probably without actually looking at anything, on August 11, 1882 that there was \$ 200.00 of cash and \$ 8,500.00 of real property (the northern half of the southwest quarter of section 15). In his final report, of August 24, 1882, Holman adds \$ 12.45 from the sale of potatoes (which were a common part of agricultural estates) and \$ 28.62 from the sale of an old stove and some other personal property. He paid some outstanding bills and charged additional costs to the estate, including a \$ 150.00 appraiser fee for himself and a $ 100.00 fee for his lawyer. Here is the list.

Clearly Evander Howe lived a minimalist and environmentally responsible life on his piece of the Vancouver Road.

What follows in the probate file are copies of the bills, and various notices from the creditors that the bills were duly paid. More interesting for our purposes is a later note, notarized on March 22, 1883, and written by Edward Holman’s attorney to Judge Stearns. It shows that George Woodward, perhaps taking a hint from the petition of Dr. Rex, had found the family.

Edward Holman, Sylvester Farrell, and W. K. Smith were waiting in the wings to start buying and selling the land.

### Family

We have seen earlier that Evander’s family lived in Vermont. In the 1850 _Federal Census_ I found Joseph Gilman Howe, a farmer, born 1809, married to Priscilla Howe (née Spalding) and living in Jamaica, Windham County, Vermont. They have five children living at home: Evander, age 15, Hannibal, age 12, Louisa, age 10, Lovina, age 7, and Sarah, age 4. Thus Evander was the oldest son. The _Vermont Vital Records_ show his birth date was March 12, 1834. It also shows the middle initial T. which disappeared over time.

Evander’s profession at 15 was listed by the census as farmer, like his dad. In the 1860 census Evander (transcribed as Elander) was 24, still living at home, a laborer. There is now also an eight year old brother Ezra Olander Howe. 

I also found a record in the _Minnesota Territorial Census_ of September 21, 1857, showing an Evander Howe, age 23, born in Vermont in 1834, living in Township 109 in the County of Nicollet. He was a laborer on the farm of Luke Rist, who was also from Vermont. And in the _Minnesota Homestead and Cash Entry Patents_ Evander Howe bought 27.62 acres of land in Blue Earth, Nicollet County, on October 1, 1860. The land office that handled the sale was in St Peter, another town in Nicollet County. Even more impressively, on December 3, 1860, Sarah Knecht, formerly the widow of Henry Stone, who was a private in Captain Wilson’s Company of the Pennsylvania Militia in the War of 1812, used the Military Bounty Act of 1855 to claim 120 acres of land in Nicollet County. She then assigned the warrant to H.W. Lamberton, who subsequently passed it on to Evander Howe. So clearly around this time Evander was moving west and had acquired some property on the way. I have copies of both patent deeds, but since they are a bit far from our bed, and transcribing them is boring, I will just give the URLs in the references. I have no idea what Evander did between 1860 and 1870.

In the 1880 census Joseph G. Howe is a widower, who lives with his daughter-in-law Maria and two grandchildren, still in Jamaica, Vermont. There is no sign of Hannibal, Maria’s husband. It is mentioned in the census that Joseph is sick of old age. He died 1882, 74 years old, in the same year as his oldest son Evander. The _Vermont Probate Records_ of 1882 show that the administrator of his estate asks permission of the probate court to sell all real estate belonging to the deceased to satisfy his debtors. There is a debt of \$ 698.77 and a personal estate of only \$ 8.50. The 8000 dollars that Geo. Woodward paid to Evander Howe’s siblings came too late to help Joseph Howe.
