Last update September 01, 2021 Introduction Piedmont Piedmont is one of the 95 neighborhoods in the neighborhood system of Portland, Oregon, and one of the eleven neighborhoods in the North Portland district coalition. Portland’s nationally recognized neighborhood system is made up of 95 recognized, independent neighborhood associations and seven neighborhood district coalition offices that represent the entire city of Portland. https://www.portlandoregon.gov/oni/28989 The Piedmont neighborhood gets its name from the Piedmont subdivision, platted in 1889 by Edward Quackenbush and the Investment Company. And the Piedmont subdivision gets its name from the region in northwest Italy, known for its gentle slopes and hillsides. I am pretty sure the name Piedmont was chosen for its commercial appeal, and not for the physical resemblance with the eponymous region in Italy, which actually looks quite different. Although:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont_(United_States) The Piedmont subdivision is only a small part of the Piedmont neighborhood, in fact less than ten percent of its area. And, conversely, only half of the Piedmont subdivision is in the Piedmont neighborhood, the rest is in Humboldt and King. Land Throughout this book, I concentrate on land and land ownership. It is essential, therefore, to remember that Oregon, Portland, and Piedmont were started by settler colonialism. This meant the United States occupied lands used for centuries by indigenous peoples, and declared it to be public lands of the United States. War, terror, vigilantes, disease, broken treaties, racism, religion, and unjust laws made sure the unceded lands stayed in the hands of the occupying forces. The small percentage of indigenous people that survived the onslaught were driven onto ever shrinking reservations. In the middle of the nineteenth century, when settlers started to arrive and Portland became a fast growing city, there were very few Native Americans left in the area. In that nineteenth century the United States adopted laws which encouraged settlement by giving large sections of public lands away (usually tracts of 160 acres), and making other sections available for very little money (usually for $ 1.25 per acre). The land that currently makes up Piedmont was donated in this way to just four people. Evander Howe, George Smith, Lewis Love, and David Ulery were all farmers on the Vancouver Road, near the Columbia Slough. They could effectively use the Donation Land Claim Act and the Military Bounty Law, because they were the first settlers to arrive, and actually for quite some time the only settlers to arrive. In the next stage the city grew because the settlers, or “pioneers”, sold their land to developers, who platted subdivisions. Piedmont over the years became differentiated from about four homesteads to about 30 subdivisions of varying sizes. From 1850 on fortunes were made by subdividing, exchanging, transfering, inheriting, buying, and selling pieces of land. In the third stage of development each of the subdivisions, sometimes also called additions, were partitioned into a varying number of city blocks, usually 200 by 200 feet, and the blocks were partitioned in lots, usually eight lots of 100 by 50 feet. These individual lots were then sold to people to build their houses, or packaged into multiple lots for speculation. Piedmont consists of thousands of such lots. In the book I will discuss the original homesteads and the subsequent subdivisions. As a consequence of this emphasis on land, the book concentrates on the time between 1850 and 1930. After 1930 development is mostly down to the level of individual lots, and since there are about 5000 of these, I cannot discuss them one by one. It is interesting, of course, to find out who built an individual house, and who the subsequent owners were. But the sheer number of them makes it impossible to write about each and every one. Bias As you will probably figure out quickly, I like maps. I also like facts, more than I like opinions. I like words, more than I like photographs. Thus this book is not of the coffee table type, with many photos and only a few words. I also do not like the view that historical developments are driven by a small number of important individuals, always men of course, and that we want to know as much as possible about these men, possibly because we want to become just like them. History is driven by social and economic forces and movements in which specific individuals are of limited and largely anecdotal significance. I like to report about structures and systems more than I like to report about people. Also, I hope that what I do report about the men and women that were important in Piedmont’s early history makes it clear that you do not necessarily want to become just like them. There are two other important types of Portland history books I do not want to emulate. Some of them are excellent, but they are not what I am interested in. There are those books that concentrate on vice, corruption, crime, shanghaiing, and prostitution. They are mostly about the northwest of Portland, between 1870 and 1910. And then there are those books that tell the story of city government and the business community, again mostly although not entirely about the part of Portland west of the river. As far as I am concerned, these two types of books talk about two sides of the same coin, a bunch of people quibbling on how to divide the loot. Of course that describes a huge part of history in general, and in this book the loot is basically two square miles of land, sections 10 and 15 in township one north, range one east of the Willamette Meridian. Technical This book is, and always will be, free and in the public domain. Anyone can copy, print, distribute or otherwise use the material in this book for any purpose whatsoever, and, if they so choose, without attribution. All references are collected in the back of each chapter or section. I have tried to make everything reproducible, in the sense that every statement of fact that I make can be traced back to its sources. I have also tried to emphasize primary (i.e. contemporaneous) sources, even if they were only newspaper articles. Secondary sources are only used, reluctantly, if primary sources are not available. I have also tried to refrain, as much as is humanly possible, from stating opinions about events, or making inferences about motives. This book is a living document, which means that any part of it can change at any moment. Thus all sections have a date attached to their title, indicating when they were last changed. I keep discovering new facts and adding new materials. In the table of contents each section is linked to a separate pdf, which is synchronized with the sections in the Google docs version of the book. This book is also, among other things, a repository. There are copies of, or links to, the original maps, deeds, photos, and newspaper articles that the narrative is based on.

Red Cloud, Lakota, around 1900 It is appropriate to start this book with a chapter on the Native Americans who were here first and who lived on the land that is currently the Piedmont Neighborhood. It turns out that this is far from easy. I will have to rely heavily on a huge amount of research on relatively sparse data, documented most thoroughly in an excellent recent edited volume. Robert T. Boyd, Kenneth M. Ames, Tony A. Johnson (eds): Chinookan Peoples of the Lower Columbia. University of Washington Press, 2013. To set the scene we start with two statues in Washington Park. The first one, on the left, is called “The Coming of the White Man”. The sculptor was Hermon Atkins MacNeil (1866 – 1947), who specialized in Native American scenes. This particular statue was gifted to the City of Portland in 1904 by former mayor David P. Thompson. It depicts two Native American men looking towards the Columbia River upon the arrival of Lewis and Clark. The older man, with arms crossed, is supposedly Chief Multnomah, the younger one is not identified. Sculptor MacNeil continued to make and sell many separate copies of the Chief Multnomah figure. There are some problems with the statue, independent of its artistic merits. First, there is a relatively minor historical problem. For a long time historians have denied that Chief Multnomah was an actual historical figure. Recent research (Fulton, 2005), relying on the native american oral tradition, maintains that he did indeed exist. He was a powerful and important chief, who controlled a large territory around the Willamette river, and commanded many warriors. He died around 1780, possibly in the first smallpox epidemic. Whether he existed or not, he was no longer living when Lewis and Clark arrived in 1804-1805. The second problem, which was unavoidable at the time, is that the statue is firmly in the white supremacist tradition of the Noble Savage, the Theatrical Savage, and the Picturesque Savage (Ellington, 2001). A good way to illustrate this is with a contemporary review of the statue by one Arno Dosch in the Pacific Monthly of 1905. Mr. MacNeil has put thought and genius into that old chief. He has depicted a patriarch in the full possession of his bodily strength, with a frame of iron, legs of steel cords and an arm of certain stroke. He stand on his toes to see better, binding his knees with tendons and drawing the cords over his thighs, hollowing the hips and bringing out the groin line clear. His are the legs of perfect strength, with the veins showing a little more prominently than in a younger man. On an upright body, with arms folded and a shield slung over the back, rises the head. In the face is the power. It is that of a Multnomah, a man of mental ability, a brooding savage, an Indian chief. He guided his own people by his wisdom, and let them in conquest on the enemy. The neck is drawn in heavy cords, and upon it is the chin of hauteur, almost disdain, the eyes expectant, but not astonished; the nose masterful, the strong hair bound back by a band._ The younger person is also described by Dosch. His attitude is in direct contrast to that of his elder. His whole body and face expresses open curiosity and wonderment. He holds aloft on his right hand a branch, just broken from a tree, and waves it as a token of good will to the strangers. At some point in time in the 1930’s someone, presumably someone with a more keen sense of history, broke off this olive branch from the statue. It has not been restored. Remember that Arno Dosch wrote in 1905. In the preceding 100 years an estimated ninety percent of the Native American population had disappeared. They largely succumbed to diseases brought by the white man. But they had also been hunted down and killed by vigilantes and slaughtered in staged so-called “Indian Wars” by the army. They were driven from their lands, tricked into signing treaties that would never be ratified, and they were forcibly removed to areas east of the Cascades, or driven onto small reservations of land that the white settlers did not want. In 1905 the expression on the face of Chief Multnomah should have alternated between immense sadness and equally immense rage. The second statue in Washington Park, the picture on the right, is “Sacajawea and Jean-Baptiste”. The sculpture was commissioned for the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition (1905) by the Committee of Portland Women, who requested a sculpture of “the only woman in the Lewis and Clark Expedition and in honor of the pioneer mother of old Oregon.” 1.1 Before Contact Archeology 1.2 Discovering the Columbia 1.3 The Lewis and Clark Journals The two visits to Native American sites in the Columbia Basin/Wapato Valley 1.4 The Wapato Valley Native Americans 1.5 The Spirit of Pestilence 1.6 The Extinction of Indian Title How the lands were taken away (In the Courts of the Conqueror, Conquest by Law). There has been some discussion as to the origin of our title to what was known as the Oregon country, comprising the State of Oregon, Washington and Idaho, and the portions of Montana and Wyoming west of the Rocky Mountains. The question wa whether our title was derived from the Louisiana Purchase or directly by discovery and prior possession. As the result of discussion by the General Land Office in 1898, the map of the United States now issued by that office states that the title was established in 1846. The exact basis of our claim has apparently never been authoritatively decided (Bien, 1910, page 388). 1.7 Present Day Multnomah County 1.8 References Morris Bien: The Public Lands of the United States.

There is only a small number of them, five or so, and the large parcels (in the blue lines) in most cases also overlap with the adjacent neighborhoods Woodlawn, Overlook, Humboldt, King, Arbor Lodge, Kenton, and East Columbia. I shall use the generic name “homesteads” for these properties, although not all of them were authorized by the homestead act, and not all the original grantees actually homesteaded on them. To put this in a larger context, here is the map of the 1860 survey of all of Township 1 of Range 1 east, which covers all of Portland, including East Portland and Albina. alt_text https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TISCAUaStTYOVqZS58E5ao4AFFOkmzSl Remember that links in the captions below pictures and photos generally point to a larger and/or higher resolution version elsewhere on the web. On the map it says, in the lower right hand corner, The above Map of the Survey of Claims in the Township No1 North Range No1 East of the Willamette Meridian, Oregon, is strictly conformable to the field notes of the surveys thereof in file at this office, which have been examined and approved. Surveyor General’s Office, Eugene City, September 20th 1860 The township and range terminology will be discussed later in this introductory chapter, in the section on the Public Land Survey System. 2.1.2 Our Discussion Each of our homestead chapters is divided into two parts. In the first part I discuss the land, how it was obtained, partitioned, and sold. In the second part I discuss the biographical information I have on the settlers who claimed the land and obtained the patents from the US government. The order of the two parts reflects the emphasis in this book on the ownership of the land, the persons are in some sense accidental, no matter how interesting their lives may have been. But sometimes the division between the land dealings and the life are somewhat artificial, because basically what we know about some of the homesteaders is precisely that they homesteaded in what is now the Piedmont neighborhood. And not much more. How the land changed hands covers a period from the original claim to the point, often some fifty years later, when the final subdivisions were platted and the plats recorded with Multnomah County. Some plats have hundreds of lots, and it is not feasible to find out and document how individual lots were sold by the original sellers, and then later by the various owners along the way. So I stop at the subdivision level, although there are some exceptions because there is land that was not platted, and there are some lots and buildings on the land with historical significance. Snyder’s 1989 book “We Claimed This Land: Portland Pioneer Settlers” is impressive, because it covers 212 “pioneers”, defined as persons or families who “were the first to settle on the land that is now occupied by the city of Portland, Oregon.” (1989, preface, page v). But 212 biographies in a book of 278 pages implies that some of them will be very short. Especially because some of the pioneers do get a lot of pages. A. P. Dennison, for example, inexplicably gets 22 pages, which is definitely not proportional to his historical importance. Moreover, Snyder concentrates on pioneers associated with the original site of the City of Portland, on the west side of the Willamette, and on the more urban tracts. This makes perfect sense, because information about them is more readily available. Our Piedmont pioneers Evander Howe (10 lines), George Smith (9 lines), and David Ulery (12 lines) are given short shrift, simply because Snyder does not have more information on them. And some of the information is incorrect or imprecise. Captain Lewis Love gets three pages, which is still not much for such a long and eventful life. John Fenstermacher gets a full page, but mostly because of the tabloid aspects of his life and death. Because we only have to consider just four or five pioneers we can dig much deeper, and find more (and more correct) information. We freely use the words “pioneers” and “settlers”, although both words have plenty of negative connotations these days (Sakai, 2014). The words seem to suggest that the white people who came from the east arrived on virgin land (the terra nullius doctrine), which was waiting to be occupied, utilized, monetarized, and exploited. The alternative interpretation of what took place in the early nineteenth century is, of course, that all that land was invaded and occupied, and the original inhabitants, the ones that did not succumb to the infectious diseases brought by the settlers, were forcibly removed and in many instances killed. As a rule the white settlers seem to have been brave, daring, inventive, hard working, and incredibly resistant to many kinds of adversity. They came to improve their situation, and many who came early succeeded in doing just that. Their improvement was made possible, however, by the racism, exceptionalism, and manifest destiny ideologies promoted by the ruling classes. And we should not forget they were, wittingly or unwittingly, part of a racist and colonialist invasion that resulted in an horrific genocide (Dunbar-Ortiz, 2014) 2.1.3 Land Laws There were multiple laws passed by Congress in the eighteenth and nineteenth century on which the various donations and patents are based. Some of them were actually donations, which means the settlers did not have to pay anything for the land, and some were for-pay, although always for very little money. Because nothing beats looking at the original documents, in the exact language they were written in, I provide links to the actual laws. In the references at the end of the chapter there are links to Wikipedia articles that provide at least some background. If you want to know more about how the United States disposed on its public lands through a whole sequence of homestead type acts, there is the authoritative article by Bien (1910). For an even more extensive discussion of the donations of various types in Oregon (including giveaways to railroads, timber harvesting, or military wagon roads) see the dissertation by Jerry O’Callaghan (1951).

May 20, 1862: An Act to secure Homesteads to actual Settlers in the Public Domain. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S1TuL2j2sMidQAdCahzAFG4hSx27SkhV On the map at the beginning of this chapter Lewis Love and John Rankin used the Oregon Donation Land Act of 1850. John Fenstermacher and Evander Howe used the Homestead Act of 1862 (which means they had to pay for their land). George Smith, Robert Maxey, and David Ulery used the Military Bounty Act of 1855. In all three cases, however, they were not the ones doing the actual military service. By informal and and by now unknowable transactions they made the original military men sign over their patents, undoubtedly for a pittance. The Oregon Donation Land Act of 1850 deserves some additional attention, because it is specific to our region. The Genealogical Forum of Oregon (2014) has a nice brochure, with the essential facts. Also quite readable is the page on the act of theOregon History Project (2018). 2.1.4 Public Land Survey System The _Rectangular Survey System** **_was created by the Land Ordinance of 1785. It covers the United States with squares of 6 by 6 miles. It then introduces a local coordinate system by designating a vertical lines (meridian) and horizontal line (base line). In our case the vertical line is the Willamette Meridian, running through the hills west of Portland, and the horizontal line is the Willamette base line, along Base Line Street (now Stark Street). The two intersect at the Willamette Stone. This local coordinate system allows one to code the squares, indicating how many squares east or west of the meridian, and how many squares north or south of the base line they are. The figure below, taken from page 25 of the excellent e-book by Vaughan (2014), show both meridian and base line. alt_text On the map at the beginning of this chapter you see modern Piedmont in the red boundaries. The black squares are sections 9, 10, 15, and 16 of Township 1 North, Range 1 East (T 1N R 1E), i.e. the first square north of the baseline and east of the meridian. A township in PLSS is six by six miles, with 36 sections. Thus T 1N R 1E covers most of Portland. A black section is a square mile, or 640 acres, and the four quarters of a section (NE, SE, SW, NW) are each 160 acres. The following figure, from page 28, of Vaughan (2014), illustrates the basics. alt_text The rectangular system is used throughout to locate parcels of land, where basically each of the townships provides another even more local coordinate system. We can now say, for example, that a piece of land in the figure above is the SE ¼ of the NW quadrant of Section 14 in township 4 south of range 3 west. Even more importantly, parcels of land, especially in the homestead period, are often defined as sections or quarters of the system, and as a consequence roads often align with boundaries of quarters as well. 2.1.5 Surveyors Lengths In many of the deeds from the nineteenth century parcels of land are described in the language of surveyors, and the boundaries are described in the units of length used by surveyors around that time. Since these units may be unfamiliar to modern readers, I briefly summarize definitions of the most common ones, and show how to translate them into feet and even meters. _The name **furlong** derives from the [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English_language) words furh (furrow) and lang (long). Dating back at least to early [Anglo-Saxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon) times, it originally referred to the length of the furrow in one [acre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre) of a ploughed [open field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-field_system) (a medieval communal field which was divided into strips). _ _A **chain** is a [unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement) of [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length) that measures 66 [feet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)), 22 [yards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yard_(unit_of_length)), 100 [links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_(unit)),&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;or 4 [rods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_(unit)) (20.1168 [m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre)). There are 10 chains in a [furlong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furlong), and 80 chains in one [statute mile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_mile). An [acre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre) is the area of 10 square chains (that is, an area of one chain by one furlong). _ _The **rod** or perch or pole is a [surveyor’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying) tool&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;and unit of [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length) equal to ​5 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [yards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yard), 16​&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [feet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(length)), ​&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;320&lt;/sub&gt; of a [statute mile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_mile) or one-fourth of a [surveyor&#39;s chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_(unit)) and 5.0292 [meters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter). The rod is useful as a unit of length because whole number multiples of it can form one [acre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre) of square measure. _ _The **link** (usually abbreviated as &quot;l.&quot;, &quot;li.&quot; or &quot;lnk.&quot;), sometimes called a **Gunter’s link**, is a [unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_unit) of [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length) formerly used in many English-speaking countries. A link is exactly ​&lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt; of a [foot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)), or exactly 7.92 [inches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch) or 20.1168 cm.The unit is based on [Gunter&#39;s chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunter%27s_chain), a metal [chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_(unit)) 66 feet long with 100 links, that was formerly used in land [surveying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying)._ Here is a table to convert links/chains/rods/furlongs to inches/feet/yards/miles and ultimately, for those of us who finally emerged from the middle ages, to meters. alt_text 2.1.6 Deeds and Patents This book contains excerpts from, transcripts of, and links to hundreds of deeds. There are many types of deeds, which are used to register the transfer of real property. There are hundreds of introductions to deeds and types of ownership of real property of the web. A good example is American Bar Association (2011). I only give a brief summary of the types we will encounter in this book. A general warranty deed guarantees that the grantor has clear title, and that no other parties retain an interest in the property. It usually includes various covenants, in particular that the grantor is responsible if it is discovered the title is not clear and third parties makes claims to the property. A_ quitclaim deed_ transfers any interest in the real property that the grantee has to the grantor, without any guarantee that the grantee actually has title to or ownership of the property. Thus the rights of the grantor in the property are transferred to the grantee, provided that the grantor actually has these rights, otherwise the quitclaim deed is just a piece of paper. A sheriff’s deed is a deed that gives ownership rights in property bought at a sheriff’s sale. A sheriff’s sale is a sale conducted by a sheriff upon order of a court after a failure to pay a judgment. These days sheriff’s deeds are used in foreclosures, in the nineteenth century they were used even more often if owners of real property failed to pay taxes or bills for goods and services. The important thing is that a court order was needed. Old newspapers have pages and pages of pieces of real estate sold at sheriff’s sales, mostly because of delinquent property taxes. For US land donations and cash transactions under the homestead law we include and transcribe (in as far as they are readable) a copy of the patent and the corresponding deed. For later transfers of real property we include copies, or links to copies, of all deeds we could find. For this chapter we follow the title chain from the US to the homesteader, and then from the homesteader to all next-stage buyers, until the whole homestead is divided up and sold, and we arrive at the subdivision plats, which eventually all will have their separate chapters in this book. As usual, links to deeds are included, and some deeds, or parts of deeds, are transcribed in the text. Because of the nineteenth century longhand, and because of the quality of the copies and microfilm, it is sometimes impossible to read part of the deed. Also, deeds are to a large extent written in legal language, portions of which are almost the same for all deeds in a certain period. In some cases we skip the boiler plate and only transcribe the variable portions. Finally, we do not transcribe the notarization of the deed, although that is typically included in the linked file. 2.1.7 Plats 2.1.8 References Wikipedia: Public Land Survey System https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Land_Survey_System Wikipedia: Link (unit) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_(unit) Wikipedia: Rod (unit) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_(unit) Wikipedia: Chain (unit) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_(unit) Wikipedia: Furlong https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furlong Wikipedia: Donation Land Claim Act https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation_Land_Claim_Act Wikipedia: Homestead Acts https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_Acts American Bar Association (2011): Understanding Real Property Interests and Deeds. https://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/law_trends_news_practice_area_e_newsletter_home/2011_summer/real_property_interests_deeds.html Champ Clark Vaughan (2014): A History of the United States General Land Office in Oregon. https://www.blm.gov/or/landsrealty/glo200/files/glo-book.pdf Jerry A.

Snyder tells us he paid $ 200. That makes sense because under the provisions of the act land was sold for $ 1.25 per acre. The complete transcribed text of the patent (General Land Office Record, 1870) follows. Whereas there has been deposited in the General Land Office of the United States a certificate of the Register of the Land Office at Oregon City, whereby it appears that pursuing to the Act of Congress approved the 20th of May 1862 “To Secure Homesteads to actual Settlers on the public domain”, and the acts supplemental thereto, the claim of Evander Howe has been established and duly consummated in conformity to law for the South West quarter of Section fifteen in Township one North of Range one East in this District of Lands subject to Sale at Oregon City Oregon containing one hundred and sixty acres according to the Official Plat of the Survey of the said Land returned to the General Land Office by the Surveyor General. Now know ye, that there is therefore granted by the United States onto the said Evander Howe the tract of land above described: the Have and To Hold the said tract of land with the appurtenances thereof unto the said Evander Howe and to his heirs and assigns forever. In testimony whereof I, Ulysses S. Grant, President of the United States of America, have caused these letters to be made Patent, and the Seal of the General and Office to be hereunto affixed.

The blue Evander Howe square, half a mile by half a mile, in the southwest corner is bounded by what is now Interstate Avenue, Kerby Avenue, Killingsworth Street, and Rosa Parks Way. Parts are in modern Piedmont (within the red boundaries), parts are in Humboldt, Overlook, and Arbor Lodge. 2.2.2 Sales Evander Howe sold eighty acres on July, 5 1870 for four hundred dollars to Elizabeth Smith, who, together with her husband George Smith, owned the 160 acres to the east since March 10, 1866. The eighty acres Evander sold to the Smiths were the lower half of the blue quadrant, i.e. the part in modern Humboldt and Overlook.

Or, to be more precise, he sold it for forty dollars on July 12, 1870 to John Hotts, his neighbor, a retired farmer on the Columbia, who went into real estate transactions later in life.

There is no Estey Howe, I think. Also, there is no Battleboro in Vermont, although there is a Brattleboro. Snyder was misinformed by the Evander Howe probate file, which mentions one Estey Howe as a possible sole heir. As we have seen, that should be Ezra Howe, and there were others. On December 27, 1883 George Woodward and Ellen M. Woodward, his wife, quitclaimed for one dollar an undivided one-third interest in the northern 80 acres to assembly and councilman Sylvester Farrell, of Everding &amp; Farrell, a huge wholesale produce, shopping, grain, salmon, and logging company. And on the same day they also transferred another undivided one-third interest in the northern half of the southwest quarter to local undertaker and capitalist Edward Holman for another dollar. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uheS9b7nigCNVkVcf4-3Ve6vU0F7mASU https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_inDXj_kQkbhkHclvA2Fw-oLh-jv_QzC August 17, 1887 a one-third interest was transferred from Farrell to Everding &amp; Farrell for $ 2,500. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LqahDe7DqF0VmlcNryMhDq1OUgd9WXNK On January 3, 1890 S.

The land had increased in value from $ 100 in 1870 to $ 40,000 in 1890. Of course very little of that appreciation benefited Evander Howe, although some of it benefited his heirs in Vermont. In other places in this book I will discuss what the Ukase Investment Company did with their 80 acres. They leased some of the land to Harry Bush for Evergreen Park and to the City for the Municipal Automobile Park. They sold some of the land to the school district for Ockley Green School and to the City for Peninsula Park. And they used 25 of the 80 acres to plat and develop the Gainsborough Addition. As we have seen the southern half of Evander Howe’s quadrant was not in Piedmont. The eastern part of this southern half became West Piedmont and Jarrett’s Addition, the western part became North Albina. 2.3 Homesteaders: Evander Howe 2.3.1 Life In the 1860s Evander Howe came from Vermont to Oregon. He does not appear even once in any of the Oregon newspapers from the time period. Eugene E. Snyder _(1989, p. 114) _says No record tells us what sort of man Evander Howe was, nor how he occupied his time in Oregon. As I began this research it was unclear when and where he was born and how old he was when he died. There is not much information, but there is a bit more than nothing. Snyder mentions he has no idea what Howe tried or did during his final years, or if he was even in Portland. But I found him in the 1880 census. He was enumerated on July 14, a 45 year old farmer living in the Willamette Precinct. The name was transcribed as Evanden, but the census form is pretty clear. His neighbor on the form is the 52 year old farmer John Hott (sic). That should actually be John Hotts. Both of them were single. Evander apparently lived alone, Hotts had a hired hand living at the same address. Another neighbor on the same census form is Davis Ulery (sic), a 49 year old farmer, with a large family. That should actually be David Ulery. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UG_QRBABD8gPf79ShC7yWP__qr3oubIK/view 2.3.2 Death Snyder tells us Evander Howe died in 1882. Initially, I was not able to find the precise date of death, or the location of the grave. But there is much useful information, as is often the case, in the probate file (Case number 858, Multnomah Court Records, 56 pages). https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xs6X_Qrkn7oQ42qUxIBs0PgluGlfWPlM As I have remarked elsewhere, probate files and cemetery records often make it easier to find out facts about a person’s death than about their life. This is partly because they arrived from different places, but they all died in Portland. Also, their birth and childhood often were lived in areas that were not yet incorporated and did not have state, county, or city administrative offices. And thirdly, there is just more bureaucratic and journalistic activity around estates and deaths than around births or marriages, partly because often the heirs tend to get into elaborate fights amongst themselves. This is, of course, especially true for large estates, because greed needs a substrate to grow on. So what did I learn from the probate file ? Evander Howe died intestate on June 24, 1882. Thus the court had to appoint an administrator to oversee the appraisal and distribution of the estate. In order to get the job potential administrators petition the court for an appointment, usually pointing out why they were especially suited for the position. In Howe’s case there were two petitioners. The first was R. G. Rex M.D. who was “one of the principal creditors of said deceased”. Also Dr. Rex had some pertinent information. In his petition he gave the precise description of Evander’s real estate, and its estimated value of $ 8,000, and he knew of the existence of “ a brother names Estey Howe residing at or near Brattleboro in Windham County in the State of Vermont.” Nevertheless Dr. Rex lost out to Edward Holman, the funeral and cremation provider, who ran “the second oldest business in Portland”, since 1854. The business still exists. See their website at https://www.holmansfuneralservice.com. There was a great deal of money in funerals, it seems, and Holman became a capitalist, and a very prominent citizen of Portland. Note that soon after he would actually own a half interest in Evander’s land.I don’t think Dr. Rex stood a chance, even though he knew the deceased and Holman did not. In his petition Holman mentioned that Evander Howe had no family in Oregon, or anywhere else, as far as he knew. But he did mention he was the principal creditor of the estate. The firm of A.P. De Lin &amp; Co, of which he was a member, was owned $ 128.00 for funeral services. The bill in question is below. It does not say where the grave was, and I still do not know where A.P. De Lin &amp; Co. generally disposed of the bodies. alt_text Being an administrator required one to agree to a financial penalty if the court found the duties of the administrator were not carried out or the powers of the administrator were misused. In the Evander Howe case Holman had to agree to a penal sum of $ 12,000. He used two sureties, Levi Anderson and councilman Sylvester Farrell, each for $ 6,000. Note again that soon after Sylvester Farrell would own a half interest in Evander’s land. The appraisers were D.W. Wakefield, L.L. Parrish, and T.J. Mattock. They concluded, probably without actually looking at anything, on August 11, 1882 that there was $ 200.00 of cash and $ 8,500.00 of real property (the northern half of the southwest quarter of section 15). In his final report, of August 24, 1882, Holman adds $ 12.45 from the sale of potatoes (which were a common part of agricultural estates) and $ 28.62 from the sale of an old stove and some other personal property. He paid some outstanding bills and charged additional costs to the estate, including a $ 150.00 appraiser fee for himself and a $ 100.00 fee for his lawyer. Here is the list. Clearly Evander Howe lived a minimalist and environmentally responsible life on his piece of the Vancouver Road. alt_text What follows in the probate file are copies of the bills, and various notices from the creditors that the bills were duly paid. More interesting for our purposes is a later note, notarized on March 22, 1883, and written by Edward Holman’s attorney to Judge Stearns. It shows that George Woodward, perhaps taking a hint from the petition of Dr. Rex, had found the family. Edward Holman, Sylvester Farrell, and W. K. Smith were waiting in the wings to start buying and selling the land. alt_text 2.3.3 Family We have seen earlier that Evander’s family lived in Vermont. In the 1850 Federal Census I found Joseph Gilman Howe, a farmer, born 1809, married to Priscilla Howe (née Spalding) and living in Jamaica, Windham County, Vermont. They have five children living at home: Evander, age 15, Hannibal, age 12, Louisa, age 10, Lovina, age 7, and Sarah, age 4. Thus Evander was the oldest son. The Vermont Vital Records show his birth date was March 12, 1834. It also shows the middle initial T. which disappeared over time. alt_text https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B94Urj3OjM7BeldUckFKSUx0blk/view Evander’s profession at 15 was listed by the census as farmer, like his dad. In the 1860 census Evander (transcribed as Elander) was 24, still living at home, a laborer. There is now also an eight year old brother Ezra Olander Howe. I also found a record in the Minnesota Territorial Census of September 21, 1857, showing an Evander Howe, age 23, born in Vermont in 1834, living in Township 109 in the County of Nicollet. He was a laborer on the farm of Luke Rist, who was also from Vermont. And in the Minnesota Homestead and Cash Entry Patents Evander Howe bought 27.62 acres of land in Blue Earth, Nicollet County, on October 1, 1860. The land office that handled the sale was in St Peter, another town in Nicollet County. Even more impressively, on December 3, 1860, Sarah Knecht, formerly the widow of Henry Stone, who was a private in Captain Wilson’s Company of the Pennsylvania Militia in the War of 1812, used the Military Bounty Act of 1855 to claim 120 acres of land in Nicollet County. She then assigned the warrant to H.W. Lamberton, who subsequently passed it on to Evander Howe. So clearly around this time Evander was moving west and had acquired some property on the way. I have copies of both patent deeds, but since they are a bit far from our bed, and transcribing them is boring, I will just give the URLs in the references. I have no idea what Evander did between 1860 and 1870. In the 1880 census Joseph G. Howe is a widower, who lives with his daughter-in-law Maria and two grandchildren, still in Jamaica, Vermont. There is no sign of Hannibal, Maria’s husband. It is mentioned in the census that Joseph is sick of old age. He died 1882, 74 years old, in the same year as his oldest son Evander. The Vermont Probate Records of 1882 show that the administrator of his estate asks permission of the probate court to sell all real estate belonging to the deceased to satisfy his debtors. There is a debt of $ 698.77 and a personal estate of only $ 8.50. The 8000 dollars that Geo. Woodward paid to Evander Howe’s siblings came too late to help Joseph Howe. alt_text https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B94Urj3OjM7BekM0bEtsUWxjXzg/view 2.3.4 References Eugene E.

Note that this was even before the land was formally assigned to David Ulery by the United States. Here is the deed. This indenture witnesses that we David Ulery and Martha Jane Ulery his wife for the consideration of Sixty two dollars to us paid have bargained and sold and by those presents do bargain, sell and convey to John Hotts the following described premises to wit: the fractional South East quarter of the North West quarter in Section fifteen in Township One North of Range One East containing thirty seven acres and seventy two one hundredth.

In the second step the Ulery’s sold lot 5, the part in Section 14, currently in Woodlawn, to Silas Jones for $ 1,050. The deed was recorded on December 19, 1881. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1C2Y59TD9k1_Jpt4FgoAvi7_1Oyme24PM The next deed records the sale of 25 acres to Lewis Washington Love, son of William Love, and grandson of Lewis Love. It was recorded on February 1, 1882. Know all men by these Presents : That we David Ulery and Martha J Ulery wife of said David Ulery of the County of Multnomah and State of Oregon, in consideration of Seven hundred (700) dollars to us paid by Lewis W.

I used a modern map to draw the boundaries on, but of course none of the streets were there in 1882, except Vancouver Road. Also, there is no guarantee that the boundaries are precise to within the millimeter, but it’s a pretty good approximation. alt_text [https://drive.google.com/open?id=18J7V0CGXE1adVcPZOBAwwANgSH4XmGJj](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18J7V0CGXE1adVcPZOBAwwANgSH4XmGJj) Compare this with a modern subdivision map. We see that the Lewis Love piece was subdivided into Beverly and Piedmont Park. The Florence Mead part became Saratoga. The Sarah McMillen part became Kirkmar, Nocera, and the Gerard Addition, as well as the Holy Redeemer complex. The Terzah McMillen part became the Gem Addition and Devine’s Addition. The John Hotts part became Lahoma, Lochinvar, Cumberland, Pacific Place, Parkway, New Albina, and the Rose Addition. alt_text The David Ulery homestead illustrates clearly the general mechanism of larger pieces of land being sold in smaller pieces, introducing more owners, and eventually resulting in many subdivisions from a small number of homesteads. More to the north the Lewis Love DLC was partitioned into relatively large pieces, but the David Ulery DLC became fractured early on. This partitioning into subdivisions also allows us to answer discomforting existential questions such as “Why does NE Rodney Ave not continue in a straight line at Bryant ?” or “Why does NE Saratoga St stop at its east end before it gets to NE Rodney Ave ?”. 2.4.3 Sales (Second Phase) In the first phase of sales we started with a military donation claim of 144 acres, consisting of four tax lots of 37 acres. It was divided into six parcels, of which five were in the modern Piedmont neighborhood. As I indicated in the introduction, I will actually try to follow the title chains to the next level, where these five larger parcels will be partitioned into subdivisions. Bear with me, this will get complicated. Nobody in the first set of buyers (John Hotts, Sarah McMillen, Terzah McMillen, Florence Meade, Lewis Washington Love) thought of actually platting and developing the land. The second phase started at the time of the consolidation of Albina, the relentless boosting by McKenna, Killingsworth, and Quackenbush, and the coming of bridges, railways, and streetcars on the East Side. All these parcels rapidly went up in value when Piedmont was platted in 1889. Sales picked up, plats were filed, and early investors made a nice profit. In many cases buyers sold in the same year they bought, and nevertheless making a considerable profit. 2.4.3.1 Lewis Washington Love alt_text Let’s start with the twenty five acres that Lewis Washington Love bought from Ulery. He sold them for $ 3,125 to W. G. Jenne on September 22, 1882. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AeyvCQDgk2Hzsy2hiAAmePk9hGdAOprF 2.4.3.1.1 Piedmont Park On February 20, 1889 W. G. and Ida J.

Stearns for $ 7,500. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Bnm-HAauK5hZohLcjlSqln5wZOVRW13f There is an interesting clause in the deed. … together with the right of road over the east 30 feet of the 10 acre tract of land adjoining the south boundary of above conveyed tract of land and saving and excepting a like right of road over the said 15 acre tract above conveyed, said rights to last till both of said tracts are made accessible by public road to both the Woodlawn Station and the Vancouver road and no longer. G. W. and Josephine C. Stearns in turn sold the parcel for $ 9,000 to D. B. Monteith on February 26, 1889.

I have not figured this one out completely yet. Clearly Jenne was unable or forgot to pay his property taxes, because Sheriff George C. Sears sold the parcel on November 26, 1894 to E.S. Rash for $ 50.00. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1c_R6kSraX5bRp-F_YsVsRYNX86PdHE6- https://drive.google.com/open?id=18GqNBpgRIBQskNp7KwteuuQvzoJh2xT1 2.4.3.2 Florence Meade alt_text 2.4.3.2.1 Saratoga The 13.38 acres that are now Saratoga have a relatively simple story. We have seen they were sold by the Ulery’s to Florence Meade for $ 1,200 on February 1, 1882. W. H. and Florence Meade in turn sold them for $ 2,750 to Julius E. Sorbin of Albany on October 17, 1882. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KLX7BJODfJs3j9rXvTBeuPeE3nSyj8CU Sorbin quitclaimed them to Hardy C.

The probate file for George Marshal shows basically that at his death there was nothing left in the estate, and the executor of the estate (his wife) had an easy job. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sHPTMHOAw8sQwdT8zWILltRa6XS1AZS7 2.4.3.3.1 Kirkmar There are two Margaretta Marshalls to be considered. The first is Margaretta Kirk-Marshall, who died in 1897. She left an estate worth almost $ 100,000, mostly consisting of real property, but the parcel in the Piedmont Neighborhood was not mentioned in the probate file. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1f7eJnJneqAYa3_yv-8K96VM1CYHH2O96 The second Margaretta is the daughter Margaretta A. Marshall, who in April 1929, with her sister Vidae L. Marshall and her niece M. Genevieve Jones, platted the 8.08 acres of the western part of the Sarah McMillan parcel, between Congress and Vancouver, as Kirkmar. Presumably the name Kirkmar is derived from Kirk-Marshall. The 100 by 450 feet chunk (1.03 acres) at Congress ? Why ? Must have been sold by Marshall’s rather early on. 2.4.3.3.2 Nocera The eastern part. First the 2 ⅚ acres that later becomes Nocera. Beginning on the quarter section line running east and west through the center of section 15, in Township one (1) north of range one (1) east, at a point 1130 feet west of the east line of said section; which said point is at the southwest corner of a parcel of land containing three and one-sixth (3 ⅙) acres heretofore conveyed to one Gustave M.

I am still pretty far from resolving all the transactions for that parcel between 1882 and the final plats around 1920, but eventually I’ll get there. It started out relatively simple. On December 27, 1882 John Hotts sold 40 acres to a consortium consisting of L. D. Brown, J. A. Strowbridge, H. J. Morrison, James C. Tolman, Edmond F. Lewis, and William P. Wright. The first four had an undivided ⅕ interest, Lewis and Wright had an undivided 1/10 interest. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VHw9Ig8Qpyy7W0kbQzZjydlQs7z2-bJy Now, of course, 40 acres is more than 37.72 acres. No magick was involved, however. In 1862 John Hotts had also bought from John Finstermacher the 67.38 acres that bordered the Ulery homestead on the west side. Remember the DLC map I already showed earlier in this chapter. Tax lots 1, 2, 3, and 5 south of the Lewis Love DLC are Ulery’s homestead, while lot 5 to the west of the Love DLC is in Finstermacher’s homestead. Things become complicated because of lot 4 in the southwest corner, which is in Finstermacher’s homestead, but is not entirely to the west of Love. The part that is south of the Love DLC is exactly the part in the current Piedmont neighborhood. On modern maps the south boundary of both Ulery and Finstermacher is Rosa Parks Way. The north boundary of Ulery is Bryant Street and the north boundary of Finstermacher’s lot 5 is Lombard Street. alt_text Story of New Albina. 2.4.3.5.1 Rose Addition.

Sold to Ernest Cawston (her brother) Feb 1905. 2.5 Homesteaders: David and Martha Jane Ulery 2.5.1 Paddy Carr We have seen that military bounty land was often passed on by the beneficiaries, undoubtedly for a small fee, to persons with more money and more of an idea of what to do with the land. This was certainly the case with MW-0229-025, where the bounty land was given to a Native American warrior. The patent says A-Chars-War-Chee was one of the 500 Creek volunteers in Captain Paddy Carr’s Company in the Creek War. This is fascinating to me, so I went off on a tangent, and did some more digging. There is very little hope to find any further information about A-Chars-War-Chee, but Paddy Carr is another matter. There are two Paddy Carr’s in the local history from around 1800 in Georgia. The first one emigrated from Ireland around 1767, started his career as an indian trader, and participated in guerilla warfare in the Revolutionary War. He was known throughout the South as “Captain Paddy Carr”and the troops he commanded consisted of dragoons and riflemen and were known as “Carr’s Independent Corps” and are sometimes referred to as “Carr’s Legion.”(O’Brien, 1922, p 93) Since the first Paddy Carr died in 1802, he cannot possibly have participated in the Creek “Red Stick” War, which was in 1813-1814 (Wikipedia, Creek War). According to the Irish historians, the second Paddy was the son of the first one. The Creek War referred to in the patent must have been the Second Creek War in Florida in 1836 (Wikipedia, Creek War of 1836), and the Paddy Carr mentioned must have been the son. Major Carr married a Creek woman and had a son named Patrick, who, like his father, was always known as “Paddy” Carr. In 1826 “Paddy” accompanied a delegation of Indians to Washington and acted as interpreter. He too became a soldier and in 1836 when the Creeks rose he took the side of the United States and marched to Florida with General Jessup at the head of 500 warriors and helped in the suppression of the Indian revolt (O’Brien, 1922, p 95) alt_text https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OvngfWlXkBOrMQyUwMzWSniiC5CxKiNe We even have a beautiful portrait of the second Paddy Carr, from the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery, done by Alfred M. Hoffy in 1838. More information about this second Paddy Carr is in McKenney and Hall (1838, p 223-225). It documents his trip as interpreter to Washington, his subsequent career as a trader, slaveholder, and landed gentleman, and his leading of 500 warriors in the Florida campaign. The young Paddy was born near Fort Mitchell, in Alabama, and, in his infancy, was taken into the family of Colonel Crowell, the Indian agent, and kindly reared in the habits of civilised life (p 223). Soon after his return from Washington, he married the daughter of Colonel Lovett, a respectable half breed, with whom he received a portion which, with the property accumulated by himself, furnished a capital sufficient to enable him to go into trade. In a few years he amassed a considerable property, and is now, in 1837, possessed of from seventy to eighty slaves, besides landed property, and a large stock of horses and cattle. (p 223) Paddy Carr has an innate passion for fine horses, and owns a large number of very valuable animals. He is fond of racing, and, when he has a trial of speed depending, if he cannot suit himself with a rider, he rides his own horse. He is of a liberal and generous disposition, hospitable to strangers, and kind to the poor. Many of the poorer class of Indians depend on him for support. He has three wives, one of whom is daughter of the ill fated General McIntosh. The two first born of his children were twin girls, and Captain Crowell, the son of his early friend and patron, having a daughter named Ariadne, he called one of his twins Ari and the other Adne, thus evincing a sense of benefits received, which is in itself one of the highest evidences of a noble mind. (p 224) Enough of Paddy Carr, and back to the main characters of this chapter. 2.5.2 Life and Death The book by Alley (1885, p. 381) has a short biographical sketch describing David Ulery. I assume Alley actually talked to Ulery, because his book was “compiled from the most authentic sources”. The subject of this sketch was born in Fayette county, Pennsylvania, May 11, 1831, but when fifteen years of age removed to Wheeling, Ohio county, West Virginia, where he was engaged in steamboating. He afterwards joined his parents in Muscatine county, Iowa, and subsequently moved to Minneapolis, and thence to Crawford county, Wisconsin, and there was married to Miss Martha J. Alcorn. In the spring of 1861 he emigrated to California via the isthmus of Panama, and after remaining in Sacramento until July of that year he came to Portland, Oregon, settled on the road between that city and Vancouver and engaged in fruit and vegetable raising for the Portland market. Disposing of that place in 1882, he took up his residence in Clark county, Washington Territory, and in the month of March took possession of the farm he now occupies in the Chelachie valley. His family consists of one son and three daughters, viz. John H., Mary, Rosa and Lena. Note that Ulery bought the farm one month after receiving 1050 + 1200 + 1200 + 2500 + 700 = 6650 dollars from the sale of his donation land claim in Multnomah County. I am pretty sure that was quite a lot more than he paid A-Chars-War-Chee for the patent. While living on Vancouver road, David Ulery was active in various public-minded activities. He served on juries and councils, and interacted with his neighbors Evander Howe, John Hotts, William Love, George Smith, and Lewis Love, all of them featuring in various chapters of this book. If appraisals were needed, or documents signings needed to be witnessed, then the neighbors helped each other, undoubtedly also because they were the only people around, living in an isolated area, far from the city. In the Willamette Farmer of March 7, 1874, we see Ulery as active in the Grange movement “a fraternal organization in the United States that encourages families to band together to promote the economic and political well-being of the community and agriculture” (Wikipedia). It’s like a rural neighborhood association. alt_text We can also follow David Ulery through the pages of the federal and state censuses. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1U8VH0G83sIc_dwDzT9OUADiaEczNtpy2 In 1850 he was 19 years old, living with his parents in Marshall county, Virginia. His profession was listed as cooper. His future wife Martha Jane Alcorn was 14, and living with her parents in Kiskiminetas, Armstrong, Pennsylvania. In 1870 Ulery was a farmer in the Willamette precinct, Multnomah county, owning $ 2,500 worth of real estate, and accompanied by his wife and children John (12) , Mary (8), Rosa (7), Benj (4) and Lisor Ann (2). In the 1880 federal census Rosa Ann (16), Benjamin (14), and Lissa (12) are still at home. In the 1900 federal census the children are not there anymore, and husband and wife are in Chelatchie county in Washington. They are by now 69 and 64 years old, and the census informs us that of their six children only three are still alive. In the 1910 census David and Martha are 76 and 74. After that, no more. alt_text The records of the Chelatchi Cemetery in Amboy, Washington (established 1892) show alt_text 2.5.3 References Michael J.

Henry Walsh immediately transferred the land to George Smith. The description of this track of land is simple: the southeast quarter of section 15, township one north, range one east. The corresponding deed was recorded with Multnomah County on June 22, 1870. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AERgX2cBf44CjtJ608IxXLA0rYUVPAQB To the west of the land now owned by George Smith was the homestead of Evander Howe, another 160 acres, the southwest quarter of section 15, township one north, range one east. As I have documented in the chapter on Evander Howe he sold the southern eighty acres of his tract on July, 5 1870 for four hundred dollars to Elizabeth Smith, George Smith’s wife. In other words, at that time George and Elizabeth owned 240 acres. That is the area in the blue boundary on the first page of this chapter. 2.6.2 Sales Eventually, in 1888, George Smith’s donation land ended up with Edward Quackenbush’s Investment Company. It was platted to become the Piedmont subdivision. But before that it changed hands many times. This is a common and unavoidable phenomenon. Lands get partitioned by inheritance or sales, and the units get smaller and smaller. The price of land goes up and sales of smaller pieces remain economically viable. The history section of the Piedmont Neighborhood Plan (Portland Bureau of Planning, 1993, page 13) says The quarter section of land which later became Piedmont was granted to Henry Walsh by the United States Government on March 10, 1866. Pursuant to an 1855 act of Congress, this land was a Bounty Land Claim for his military service in the Mexican-American War. After changing hands several times between 1870 and 1888 with many legal questions over ownership, the entire parcel was sold for $ 24,000 to the Investment Company on June 22, 1888. This is a nice compact summary, and it even is mostly correct, but there is not enough detail for my purposes. It does not even mention George Smith, and the alleged legal questions are interesting. So I have filled in the details. To some this may appear tedious, but it was a lot of work and it seems useful to document it once and for all. On August 2, 1870 George and Elizabeth Smith sold their 240 acres for $ 2,400 to H.F. Bloch and A.P. Dennison. Note that they recorded the deed to their 160 acres in June 1870, and they added the 80 acres of Evander Howe in July 1870. They moved quick. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PrnthO0q74hsYLIL4BryA5t0xg84IstH Bloch and Dennison, who we will talk about a bit more in another chapter of this book, also used the land for speculative purposes only. They quickly sold it as well, in three pieces. On January 12, 1872 to P.J. Smith and C.H. Burrage for $ 1,250, the southwest quarter of the southwest quarter of section 15, 40 acres. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SpPjBuKXLwY_xzwj2n5JEV5HBprK1APU On January 31, 1872 to Isaac Dillon for $ 1,250, the southeast quarter of the southwest quarter of section 15, 40 acres. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1T3nOZezPJA-7KUNX8QLEy2KCWF35QFJ4 On February 26, 1872 to P. J. Martin and D. F. Harrington for $ 5,000, the southeast quarter of section 15, 160 acres. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1T4CsSZM13xThPJCuBKasscWgOf98NqBZ Note that the southern half of Evander Howe’s homestead claim is not in the modern Piedmont neighborhood, so I will not further follow the title chains for that piece of land. At least not for now. Eventually that half will host the subdivisions West Piedmont, North Albina, and Jarrett’s Addition. After Bloch and Dennison sold there were various complications with sales of the southeast quarter of section 15, the original George Smith claim, mostly because of internal problems in the Edward Martin family empire, which are discussed in detail in our P.J. Martin chapter. For our purposes here it is sufficient to know that around 1858 Edward Martin started, among other things, the wholesale liquor business E. Martin &amp; Co. in San Francisco, partnering with D. V. B. Henarie, who ran the daily management of the firm. Edward’s brother Patrick J. Martin, universally known as P. J. Martin, moved to Portland in 1868 and went into the real estate business here. Edward’s sons, Thomas S. Martin and Edward Martin moved to Portland around 1880 to start a nominally independent Oregon liquor business with the same name. They did not do very well, however, and soon the Portland company was $ 50,000 in debt to the San Francisco company. They went into receivership, and the assets of the Oregon company were subsequently bought by the San Francisco company. In 1880 Edward Martin Sr. died and P. J. Martin moved back to San Francisco. Much more on the Martin family is in the chapter that discusses them in more detail. It is of interest that events in the Martin family are reflected in the real estate sales in Portland. First, D. F. Harrington quitclaims, for $ 1, his interest in the 160 acres to P. J. Martin on June 16, 1877. Note that Harrington, a member of Portland’s Common Council (now the City Council), moved to San Francisco in 1877. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1N4hmqbWHuECF7OjmyULRPtPY1MCQkh59 On February 14, 1881 P. J. Martin and Margaret A. Martin his wife quitclaim, for $ 1, the 160 acres to their nephews Thomas S. Martin and Edward Martin. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RtBq1Y2S3U-mi75Wis5LmEshP5JkYTcL/view On July 12, 1881 P. J. Martin and Margaret A. Martin his wife use a warranty deed for $ 5 to grant the 160 acres of George Smith’s DLC to Thomas S. Martin and Edward Martin, together with other pieces of land in Clackamas and Marion counties. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RuH3FA4Gx5Z5QTQsUt1N0KX1aC_rt4xv/view These two last quitclaims are at the time that Thomas and Edward moved to Oregon after the death of their father. Presumably they were his legal heirs. At the time Thomas was 27, and Edward was 25. Pretty quickly, however, their fortunes went south. Literally. In the Oregonian of April 19, 1882 we see the first sign of trouble with the ownership of Edward Jr. and, especially, Thomas Martin. alt_text The Portland branch of E. Martin &amp; Co. was getting into trouble. On April 10, 1883 Edward Martin granted Power of Attorney to his uncle P. J. Martin. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xANQ1n1yvlb1jMgQfrHH5u3sXKHn5HlF This was at the same time that the company was entered into receivership, and a receiver was appointed to sell off the assets. Then, on April 10, 1883, Thomas S. Martin and Edward Martin sold the 160 acres to Daniel V. B. Henarie for $ 40,000. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IKrgbQykJurwWGCuvgRF51zu25uekfDG That seems to be too much money. But remember that E. Martin &amp; Co. of Portland still owed to E. Martin &amp; Co. of San Francisco, controlled by Henarie, more than $ 25,000. This may have been one way in which the delinquent brothers were helped to pay off their debts. On February 12, 1884 Thomas S. Martin and Ada B. Martin his wife sold their interest in the 160 acres, together with substantial parcels of land in Clackamas, Marion, Wasco, and Baker county to Edward Martin for $ 4,000. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ELF2NrYzc3LoVIwAbLJLKXINnMtwX4qj An article from the Morning Oregonian of May 9, 1888, included below, indicates that he got rid of his title and interest in E. Martin &amp; Co. around the same time. It is interesting that people quitclaim parcels to which they do not have clear and free title. Although it largely stays in the family. Edward L. Dorn would have none of it. There is a deed from February 2, 1888 in which Thomas A. Jordan, Sheriff of the County of Multnomah, grants the 160 acres of the Smith claim to E. L. Dorn. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Z6myupQds23-rOQAo80rPbrn1pDUFUae I’ll transcribe this deed, complete with all its legal jargon, annoying repetitions, and lack of punctuation, because it is different from others in this book, and because it documents what happened at this point in time to Edward Martin and the Smith grant. Also, Sheriff’s deeds are inherently more complicated than general warranty deeds or quitclaim deeds, and give more information about the actual historical situation. This one shows how sons of millionaires can get into trouble, even if other millionaires are trying to bail them out. This indenture, made the second day of February, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty eight, between Thomas A. Jordan, Sheriff of the County of Multnomah, the party of the first part, and E. L. Dorn, the part of the second part, witnesseth. That whereas by virtue of a writ of Execution and Order of Sale issued out of and under the seal of the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for the County of Multnomah, dated the 28th day of March, A. D. 1887, upon a judgment docketed in the said Court on the 26th day of March, 1887, in favor of R. D. Freeborn, plaintiff and against Edward Martin, defendant, to the said Sheriff directed and delivered, commanding him that, out of the personal property of the said judgment debtor in his County, he should cause to be made some money in the said write specified, and if sufficient property of the said judgment debtor could not be found, then he should cause the amount of the said judgment to be made out of the real property belonging to said judgment debtor on the 26th day of March, A.D. 1887, or at any time afterward. And, whereas, because sufficient property of said judgment debtor could not be found, whereof the said Sheriff could cause to be made moneys specified in said writ, the said Sheriff did, on the fourth day of April, A.D. 1887, in obedience to said command, levy on, take and seize all the right, title, interest and claim which the said judgment debtor so had to the lands, tenements, real estate and premises hereinafter particularly set forth and described, with the appurtenances, and did on the ninth day of May, A.D. 1887, sell all the right, title, interest and claim of the sad judgment debtor in and to the said premises at public auction, in front of the Court House, in the City of Portland, in said County of Multnomah, between the hours of nine in the morning and four in the afternoon of that day namely: at 10 o’clock, A.M. after first having given due notice of the time and place of such sale, according to law, to wit: By posting notice of the time and place of sale, particularly describing the property for four weeks successively prior to the date of sale, in three of the most public places, in the County of Multnomah, and also by publishing a copy of such notices once each week for four successive weeks prior to said date of sale in the Sunday Welcome, a weekly newspaper of general circulation, printed and published in Multnomah County, State of Oregon, at which sale all the right, title, interest and claim of the said judgment debtor in and to the said premises were struck off and sold to the said R.D. Freeborn, for the sum of two hundred and forty five dollars, lawful money of the United States of America, the said R.D. Freeborn being the highest bidder, and that being the highest sum bid for the same, whereupon the said Sheriff , after receiving from the said purchaser the said sum of money so bid aforesaid, gave to the said purchaser such certificate of sale as is by law directed to be given, and the matters contained in such a certificate were substantially stated in said Sheriff’s return of his proceedings upon said write to the County Clerk of the said County of Multnomah. And, whereas, the said Court by an order dated the 10th day of September 1887 confirmed said sale and four months have expired since the confirmation of said sale by said Court without any redemption of the said premises having been made: and whereas by an assignment duly made upon said certificate the said R.D. Freeborn has duly transferred all right therein to the party of the second part. Now this indenture witnesseth that the said Thomas A. Jordan, the Sheriff aforesaid, by virtue of the said writ, and in pursuance of the Statute in such case made and provided, for and in consideration of the said sum of money, to him in hand paid, as aforesaid, by the said party of the second part, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, has granted, bargained, sold, conveyed, and confirmed, and by these presents does grant, bargain, sell, convey, and confirm unto the said party of the second part and to his heirs and assigns forever, all the right, title, interest, and claim which the said judgment debtor Edward Martin had on the said fourth day of April, A.D. 1887, or at any time afterwards, or now has, in and to all that certain lot, piece or parcel of land, situated, lying and being in the said County of Multnomah, State of Oregon, and bounded and particularly described as follows, to wit: The South East quarter of section fifteen in township one North range one East of the Willamette Meridian. Together with all and singular the hereditaments and appurtenances thereunto belonging or in any wise appertaining. To have and to hold the said premises with the appurtenances, unto the said party of the second part, his heirs and assign forever, as fully and absolutely as the said Sheriff can, may, or ought to, by virtue of the said writ and of the statute in such case made and provided, grant, bargain, sell, convey and confirm the same. In witness whereof the said Sheriff, the said party of the first part, has hereunto set his hand and seal, the day and year first above written. Remember, however, that Daniel B. V. Henarie paid Thomas and Edward Martin $ 40,000 for the land, and that Thomas subsequently quitclaimed his interests to Edward. Thus there was no clear title for E. L. Dorn, although he legally obtained Edward Martin’s interests for $ 245 from R. D. Freeborn, who won them during the Sheriff’s sale. The court had to settle that the quitclaim for $ 40,000 was actually a mortgage on the property to pay off the debt, and that Edward Martin consequently had a clear title. alt_text It is unclear how the court case ended, and if Dorn got his land in Clackamas County (320 acres, by the way). Probably. In May 26, 1888 E. L. Dorn and Kate Orr Dorn his wife quitclaimed the Smith grant of 160 acres to the Investment Company for $ 1. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SizrqEp901cz4Pdn97HEpMl-y5TInobm Edward Martin was involved in one last sale of the property. One June 1, 1888 there is a warranty deed from Edward Martin to Charles A. Neal for $ 1,500. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rNYlyJ9DI1VtsBgHddZ5FVp8kxt0zaUu The deed has the usual language, but says: And I, the grantor above named, do covenant to and with the said Chas. A. Neal, the above named grantee, his heirs and assigns, that the above granted premises are free from all encumbrances made, executed, or suffered by said grantor, save a conveyance of the same to D.V.B. Henarie, made or intended as a mortgage, recorded on page 368 of book 66 of the records of deeds of said County, and that I will and my heirs, executors, and administrators shall warrant and forever defend the above granted premises, and every part and parcel thereof against the lawful claims and demands of all persons whomsoever, claiming or to claim the same by, from, through or under the said grantor. For $ 1,500 Edward Martin was out of the picture. The next step is a deed of June 2, 1888 from D. V. B. Henarie to Charles A. Neal for $ 24,000. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E2zdE1VlfCVA49PHvge9IaFZz82BIZdk It says: The object of this conveyance is to discharge and release the said real estate from the lien and encumbrances thereupon created by operation of the deed from Thomas S. Martin and Edward Martin to me, recorded upon the records of deeds of Multnomah County, State of Oregon, on page 368 of book 66, the same having been made and intended as a mortgage and to satisfy and discharge a judgment lien docketed in the judgment lien docket of said County and State on Oct. 6 1886, against said Edward Martin for $ 2569.92. And now, finally, with all of the Martins no longer involved, on June 26, 1888 Charles A. Neal, deeds the Smith claim for $ 24,000 to the Investment Company. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Sh2UmtFNRpZD-THByooAPiQ_7ME5dDEu The next year the development of Piedmont started. 2.7 Homesteaders: George and Elizabeth Smith 2.7.1 Life As explained earlier the military donation claim of Henry Walsh in 1866 was immediately transferred to George Smith. The claim was recorded in June 1870, but in the same year George and his wife Elizabeth sold all their property in Multnomah County. Snyder (1989, p.232) has no personal information about George and his wife Elizabeth Smith, only the dates from the deeds. I will try to come up with more, but for now it will be tentative. Clearly George and Elizabeth Smith did not stay very long in the Piedmont real estate limelight, basically only for a few months in 1870. I have not been able so far to find any definite information about them in the local papers or in the census and the usual ancestry sources. One problem I also mention in the chapter on Liverpool Liz is that there are just too damn many Smiths, and even too many George and Elizabeth Smith pairs. It is difficult to tell them apart without information about birth, death, or place of residence. For a moment I thought that maybe this Elizabeth Smith was actually the same person as Liverpool Liz, who was of course also an Elizabeth Smith (among other things). But I am pretty sure Liverpool Liz was born around 1860, and it is unlikely she would have bought the 80 acres from Evander Howe when she was 10 years old. At that time she was probably still playing with her sailor dolls on the other side of the Atlantic. I do have one hypothesis, however. It is somewhat wild and unsupported, but I’ll continue to test it. The idea is that the homesteaders in our area were all farmers and neighbors on Vancouver Road, on or just south of the Columbia Slough, in the Willamette Precinct. Lewis Love, William Love, Evander Howe, John Hotts, John Rankin, and David Ulery all lived in that area. Only John Fenstermacher did not, but he sold the homestead he acquired in the Willamette precinct immediately to John Hotts. When William Love died in 1878 and an administrator had to be appointed for the estate, the appraisers were David Ulery and John Hotts. When John Rankin’s wife died in 1860 and a guardian had to be appointed in 1871 for the heirs who were still minors, the appraisers of the estate were William Love, David Ulery, and John Hotts. Seems a pretty close knit group of neighbors to me. Or, to give it a slightly different emphasis, nobody else lived anywhere near. The 1870 federal census for the Willamette precinct shows David Ulery and John Hotts as census neighbors, meaning that their homes were visited by the census person directly after each other. Another census neighbor was G. A. Smith, a 26 year old farmer, owner of land valued at $ 4,000. That is George Aaron Smith. His wife Elizabeth was 21, and his children Caroline (5), Rosetta (3), and Charles (1) lived at home. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UIogLrnVAXkM8sVKXJcR3YxfC4tV2YHi Some further research shows that Elizabeth’s maiden name was Rankin, and that she was the oldest daughter of John Rankin, a neighbor to the east of Vancouver Road. She was born March 28, 1849, ad she married George Smith in 1863, when she was 14. In the 1880 federal census we do no longer see the Smith’s in Willamette precinct, but Hotts and Ulery are still there. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UG_QRBABD8gPf79ShC7yWP__qr3oubIK In fact, by 1880 George and Elizabeth had moved to Chinokville, Pacific County, Washington, across the river. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UU2IgfGrWXRdtqwK6oOjGDbCDP8moWW0 Everybody now is ten years older, and they have been joined by offspring Louise (8), George (5), Ellen (3), and John (1). In the 1900 and 1920 census the Smith family had moved to Camas Valley in Douglas County, Oregon. alt_text To get a somewhat clearer picture of the numerous offspring I made a little table with ages in the various census records. In 1860 Elizabeth still lives with her parents, in 1870 and 1880 the family lives in Chinokville, and in 1900 and 1920 in Camas Valley. George Smith died in 1915, Elizabeth on October 14, 1925. They were both buried in the Murray Cemetery in Camas Valley. 1860 1870 1880 1900 1920 George A. 36 46 65 Elizabeth 11 21 31 51 70 Caroline E. 5 14 Rosetta M. 3 12 Charles W. 1 11 31 50 Louise 8 George 5 Ellen 3 John 1 David 18 Frank B. 15 32 Roseanna 13 My hypothesis is that this George Aaron Smith and this Elizabeth Rankin Smith were the ones who acquired Henry Walsh’s bounty claim and Evander Howe’s homestead, and subsequently sold it to Bloch and Dennison. They did have enough money to buy the land, because Elizabeth sold her share of her mother’s inheritance to her father for $ 2,000. In the deeds, linked below, note that George does not use his middle name, so that the grantors are named as George Smith and Elizabeth Smith, his wife. The deeds are recorded 10/18/1866 and 10/7/1867, which is the same year George Smith obtained the donation land claim land from Henry Walsh. https://drive.google.com/open?id=19zKctuiu8d2cL95mnl4g5m6PmideYJEL https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RZpk8x_zAPfMMV4olhiKeQKZh6CTRV3A As I said, the evidence that this George A. Smith and Elizabeth Rankin are actually the ones the obtained the DLC is circumstantial, but they did live in the area and they did come into some inherited money at the time. 2.7.2 References Eugene E.

For the moment, ignore the fact that the recipients name is spelled differently as the one in the title of this chapter. The deed corresponding to the patent was not recorded with Multnomah County until January 17, 1880. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pEM1Kkg_eau6sihj6llVo3_lHohzUKzL The precise description of the land is The Fractional West Half of the North West quarter of Section Fifteen or the lots numbered Four and Five of Section Fifteen in Township One North of Range One East. The following small map with donation claims and lot sales makes the description someone clearer. alt_text Note that the west boundary of the Lewis Love DLC corresponds to what is now the I-5 freeway, while the south boundary is Bryant Street. Thus only a tiny sliver of Findsermacker’s land is in modern Piedmont, only about the eastern third of lot 4, in fact about 14 acres. The rest is in modern Arbor Lodge. Also note that the map has an error, because the total acreage for lots 4 and 5 on the map is 28.00 + 38.38 = 66.38, while the patent specifies that Fenstermacher bought 67.38 acres. It looks as if the original intention was to make lot 4 equal to 20 chains by 20 chains, i.e. a quarter mile by a quarter mile, or 40 acres. In any case, he did not hold on to it for very long. Thus his role in the history of Piedmont is almost infinitesimal, but his life story is too interesting not to tell. 2.8.2 Sales Fenstermacher sold his land on October 27, 1862 to his neighbor John Hotts for $ 100. Remember that he paid 67.38 x 1.25 = 88.23 dollars for it. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DwiA9jG8GjMOpf6xq22ON1Ax6Y3WGZYw Note that the sale to Hotts was registered one year before the legal patent was issued, and a full 18 years before the patent was registered with the county. John Hotts sold part of the Fenstermacher homestead to Charles M. Russell for $ 6,740 in 1882. What he actually sold were the 53.92 acres of the 67.38 acres that were not in the current Piedmont neighborhood, i.e. the rectangle west of what is now the freeway. There are actually two deeds registering for this sale. The first is dated May 26, 1882 https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JLonTz-Zm4J3v_atSmHv_VX-H6I091yg and the second June 27, 1882 https://drive.google.com/file/d/17PD9EwJ5-ADllUjGLLNrxe1rqDGZABNw The reason there are two deeds may be the nineteenth century equivalent of a typo. In the first deed the parcel is described as having an east boundary on the line separating sections 9 and 15. That should be sections 10 and 15, of course, and that was duly corrected in the second deed. As for the 67.38 - 53.92 = 13.46 acres of Fenstermacher’s homestead in modern Piedmont, that part was included in the sale of 40 acres by John Hotts for $ 12,000 to a consortium consisting of Lorenzo D. Brown, J. A. Strowbridge, H. J. Morrison, James C. Tolman, Edmond F. Lewis, and William P. Wright. The first four grantees had a ⅕ interest, the last two a 1/10 interest. The remaining 40 - 13.46 = 26.54 acres came from the 37.72 acres (i.e. lot 3 on our little map) John Hotts bought from his other neighbor David Ulery on May 2, 1863. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VHw9Ig8Qpyy7W0kbQzZjydlQs7z2-bJy On January 19, 1883 the same six gentlemen platted their 40 acre parcel as the New Albina subdivision. For some reason New Albina never got developed as such, and the land was partitioned, sold off, and later platted as the smaller subdivisions Cumberland, Parkway, Pacific Place, Lahoma, and Lochinvar. These later sales are more appropriately discussed in the David Ulery homestead chapter. alt_text https://drive.google.com/open?id=1G9_RqgL55Ze2Uy4J2ls4kkrCqfnPU7cV alt_text 2.8.3 References Morning Oregonian 05/19/1887.

And various permutations of these variations. Because of later developments, discussed below, I will use Fenstermacher. Snyder (1989, p 80-81) suggests the different spellings are there because Fenstermacher did not know how to write. No matter how you spell it, it means windowmaker. It suggests an Amish or Pennsylvania Dutch origin, and indeed there are many Fenstermachers in Pennsylvania. But, like for his homesteading neighbor Evander Howe, initially the details about John Fenstermacher’s life are scarce and hard to come by. As is often the case, as we saw with both Liverpool Liz and Evander Howe, information becomes more readily available at death. Probate file. So let us look into the sad death of John Fenstermacher. He died May 17, 1887, and was buried in Lone Fir Cemetery, section 19, lot 26, grave 2S. The excellent Find-a-Grave site has a picture of the gravestone, which also tells me he was 63 years old when he died, leading us to believe he was born in 1824. His grave is in Lone Fir Cemetery, marked by a weathered shaft of marble with one simple decoration, a bundle of wheat – reference to the Biblical assurance that “He will gather His wheat unto Himself” (Snyder, 1989, p. 81). Of course the gravestone does not tell us how he died, or who paid for the obelisk and the grave site. My guess is it was paid for by the State of Oregon, which was, at least initially, the beneficiary of his death. Next on my search I found two articles from the Morning Oregonian, the first from May 19, 1887, and the second from May 9, 1888. I summarize their story, which has some temporal peculiarities. Remember the official date of death is May 17, 1887. Here is the first article. alt_text The article says that “yesterday” John Fenstermacher tried to commit suicide by cutting his throat with a razor at his own residence on Asylum Road. Let’s assume that “yesterday” is, indeed, May 17, 1887. W. F. McMonies, a neighbor, found him and eventually got him to Dr. Coley who dressed his wounds. After his wounds were dressed he was able to talk readily, and told the doctor he had committed the rash act on account of being disappointed in a love affair. The second article of May 9, 1888 says that on May 17, 1887 the second suicide attempt, this time by hanging, was successful. This obviously corresponds with the official date of death. The article says Previously he made an attempt on his life by cutting his throat. Snyder (1987, p. 80) has a lurid account of the two suicide attempts. In fact, he even describes a third attempt, also involving a razor, and for both failed attempts he gives the names of the doctors, and even the amount of their bills. I am not sure where that information comes from, because of Snyder’s infuriating habit not to give references and sources, and to be rather cavalier about names and dates. Again, his books are very useful, but they would have been so much more useful with suitable notes and references. Anyway, let’s copy here what Snyder says on his page 80. Lying in a pool of blood with his throat cut, John Finstamaker (or Findermacker – his name was spelled various ways because he did not know how to write) was found in his bachelor’s farmhouse one day in the spring of 1887 by a neighbor, William Monies. John was still alive, so Monies got him into a buggy and whipped off to try to find a doctor before the victim bled to death. He had to drive to various offices before finding a doctor in. “At last,” as Monies said in his account of the incident, he found a Dr. Coles, who “operated on the cut neck, charging $50.” This was the second time John had tried to commit suicide. The first time Dr. John Sellwood had repaired the damage for $ 25. But the third time was the charm. John died by his own hand May 17, 1887, and, hopefully, found the piece he was seeking. He was 63 years old. What disappointments, what self-recrimination, regrets or remorse may have tortured poor old John, God alone knows. Not just God, it turns out. Fenstermacher told the reporter of the Oregonian that he was “disappointed in a love affair”. Snyder also has the names of the doctor, of the victim, and of the neighbor wrong, or at least different from what the Oregonian has. In subsequent remarks on the Fenstermacher inheritance and relatives he also makes various mistakes, so I am not sure about the veracity of what he describes as the first attempt. Also note that according to the information we have so far, Fenstermacher cut his throat in May 17, then was taken to Good Samaritan, and then hung himself on the same day. This seems an unlikely sequence of events. For a more plausible story we rely on information from the Statesman Journal of June 19, 1887. alt_text This suggests Fenstermacher was committed after his suicide attempt, did some gardening on the hospital grounds for a month, and then hung himself on June 17, 1887. It implies, of course, that the official day of death, which is on the grave in Lone Fir, is incorrect. Whoever paid for the grave used the first suicide date as the day of death – but Fenstermacher managed to live another month after his official death. Be that as in may, the second Oregonian article of May 9, 1888 gives some interesting personal details, probably gathered from neighbors and other acquaintances. Fenstermacher came to Oregon as a private in the US Army, and fought under Sheridan in a battle with Indians at the Cascades. After his death his personal property was found buried in various places. He had also mentioned to these same acquaintances or neighbors that he made several substantial deposits, but because he did not mention in which bank, they could not be found. He was a miserly person, never known to expend a cent unnecessarily; and some who knew him intimately say that in his greed for wealth, he even deprived himself of sufficient to eat. In addition He never spoke of himself or family relations, and no one here ever knew from whence he came, hence, after his death, all efforts to learn as to whether of where he had lawful relatives were unavailing, although no little trouble was taken in the premises. As a result of all this secretiveness there was no testament to be found. Fenstermacher died intestate, and his estate, worth $ 15,000, by law escheated to the State of Oregon on May 20, 1888. Note that inflation calculators tell us that $ 15,000 in 1887 dollars is $ 375,000 in 1917 dollars. A considerable amount of money, to be sure. Also, in the Notes from East-Portland, on the site of the Genealogical forum of Oregon, we find the following clipping. alt_text And in the Morning Oregonian of June 19, 1888 we see how the state disposed of the Fenstermacher land in East Portland. alt_text Just for completeness, here are the two deeds. First State of Oregon to Svetland https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Yfi9f7CFIhlfu4t7IdbEwe80zBAszlfu And then State of Oregon to Hobson https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ShOldKWWl6DtrqTjBwCFL5HQnihO_-E2 2.9.2 The Heirs After 1888 all should have gone quiet. But it didn’t. News of Fenstermacher’s death, and of the large amount of money sitting in the state’s coffers, soon reached Pennsylvania. And these alleged relatives, or their lawyers, flocked to Oregon to sue the state and to prove to the courts they were indeed the legal heirs. It is not easy to disentangle all these lawsuits, but I shall try. In the process a lot of new information about John Fenstermacher will come to the fore. The first case was filed in Multnomah Circuit Court by Peter Fenstermacher et al. on May 25, 1889. Judge Stearns appointed Mr. George A. Brodie to investigate their claims. I am not sure what Mr. Brodie found, but the court ruled the plaintiffs were not the relatives of John Fenstermacher. On March 10, 1890 Judge A. H. Tanner represented another batch of alleged heirs in the same court. He asked to send a commissioner to Pennsylvania to “take testimony”. Judge Stearns said he had already made his ruling in the previous case, and “further proceedings in the matter must be carried to the supreme court”. On October 27, 1890 the Oregon Supreme Court refused to overrule the circuit court’s decision. Skip to 1897. In the San Francisco Call of June 16, 1897 it is reported that 67 Fenstermacher relatives, represented by the firm of Emmons &amp; Emmons, began suit in the Multnomah Circuit Court. In connection with this suit Attorney Chester A. Dolph was commissioned by Governor Lord to go East and investigate the claim, and his report was adverse to the heirs. The Morning Oregonian of April 8, 1898 mentions that Judge Sears dismissed the suit, of Alice Reonbault et al. vs the State Of Oregon, because Emmons &amp; Emmons failed to produce two witnesses … of which one – J. Schaefer – has died since the action was begun, and the other – Harry Monice – has gone to the Klondyke. The article also mentions another suit going on, championed by Attorney J.C. Moreland, “who is now East gathering testimony”. More detail about this latest lawsuit is in the Morning Oregonian of February 28, 1898. Plaintiffs are Amos L. Young, Charles W. Young, Sue Osterman, Mary Osterman, and Elizabeth Osterman. Amos and Charles Young maintained they were sons of Lavina Fenstermacher, a sister of John Fenstermacher. The Osterman women were daughters from a second marriage of John Fenstermacher’s mother. Mary Osterman and Elizabeth Osterman are of unsound mind, and J.C. Moreland has been appointed their guardian ad litem. The article briefly summarizes the proceedings in the earlier lawsuits in Judge Stearns’ court. At the time of this suit several attorneys went to Pennsylvania, and found the Fenstermachers were a very prolific race, and thick as fleas in that state, but none of them could establish relationship with this Fenstermacher. Some additional information was provided by these alleged relatives about John Fenstermacher. He enlisted in the army in Pennsylvania, and then came west with his regiment to Walla Walla. He had a tendency “for deserting from the army every now and then”. This was supposedly born out by army records. It made me curious. There is a 1873 army pension application, under number R. 3,524, for service in Pennsylvania by John Fenstermacher, which was actually rejected, perhaps because of later desertions. Ancestry.com also has a June 1863 civil war draft registration record from the counties of Schuylkill and Lebanon in Pennsylvania, where John Fenstermacher, 39 years old, a merchant, is declared eligible for the draft. alt_text https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RcUv1nvTcXDlx2JBSKsxeNAYsrr6SSAQ The Morning Oregonian of March 21, 1898 made some coastal elitist fun of the simple souls in Pennsylvania. They got hold of a March 5th, 1898 letter from a Mrs. Amanda Laubach, from Kreidersville, Northampton County, Pa., addressed to “Any Postmaster in the State of Oregon”. Mr Jehtelmen Will you Pleas and Let me no if John Fenstermacher is Died in the State of Oregon. If not ask the Justice of the Peace if you Pleas. We Se in the Paper that John Fenstermach Died and left a big estate. He Disappeared From here in 1858 Where he bought an Ammence tract of land. He died a hermit. I will give you some of the Fenstermacher Name. The Oregonian continues Then follows a list of names as long as the list of patriarchs given in the fifth chapter of Genesis, and which might be as interesting, if it only stated how long each Fenstermacher lived and whom he begat. Unlike the previous lawsuits, this last one had legs. Attorney J.C. Moreland had done his homework, and produced a long string of witnesses. The state, in the person of Attorney Chester V. Dolph, also put up a fight. Before we go into the arguments, we may as well summarize the Fenstermacher story, as argued by the plaintiffs. The clearest statement is in the Pacific Reporter, from when the case reached the Supreme Court. To prove their heirship, they gave evidence to the effect that in 1826 or 1827 one George Fenstermacher and Elizabeth Newhard were married in Pennsylvania, and as a result of such marriage four children were born to them, to wit, LaVina, Jonas, Amanda, and John; the two latter of whom died at an early age, unmarried. About 1837 or 1838 the father deserted the family, and was never afterwards heard of. Lavina, the eldest daughter, then a girl 10 or 11 years of age, went out to work, and was subsequently married to John Young, a stage driver, by whom she had three children, one of whom died in infancy, and the other two are plaintiffs in this action. The mother, Elizabeth, with her two sons, after living among her relatives a short time, went to the Northampton poor house in 1839. From there Jonas was bound out to one David Keller of Stroudsburg, Pa., where he remained five or six years. He then went to learn the brick mason’s trade with a man by the name of Deal, with whom he remained a short time, and then went away to shift for himself. After remaining at the poor house for a time, his mother married one Osterman, by whom she had three children, who are also plaintiffs in this case. She died July 22, 1889. Single mother, poor house, son given in bondage, two daughters judged to be “insane” from a second marriage. Just to be complete I checked the Federal Census in Pennsylvania. In the 1850 Census in Denison, Luzerne, Pa., we find Lavina Young (23), married to John Young (28), with children Elizabeth (6), and Amos T. (2). In the 1860 Census in Lausanne, Carbon, Pa., we find Domnick Osterman (53), married to Osterman (no first name, 52), with children Susan (17), Joseph (13), Elizabeth (10), and Mary (7). Those are our plaintiffs, all right. The story continues with Jonas Fenstermacher’s military career, illustrating why he was denied a civil war pension. The plaintiff’s further gave evidence to the effect that in June, 1855, a young man calling himself John Fenstermacher enlisted at Wilkesbarre, Pa., in Company G, 9th regiment, United States infantry, and afterwards came with his company to this coast. After he enlisted he was arrested, or his arrest attempted, on a warrant under the name of Jonas Fenstermacher; but by some arrangement or management of the captain the officer was not allowed to take him, and he went on with his company. At Ft. Simcoe, about 1858 or 1859, he was accused of desertion, caught, flogged, and dishonorably discharged. Five years later he was in Portland, bought and sold various pieces of land, grew fruit and raised cattle on Asylum Road, lead a lonely and miserly life, and managed to scrape together a small fortune. But eventually the demons from his past got the better of him, and in a second or third attempt he killed himself. From Polk’s Portland City Directories we find that in 1885, 1886, and 1887 John Fenstermacher lived on Asylum Road. In 1885 he was listed as a farmer, in 1886 and 1887 as a fruit grower. Asylum Road in East Portland used to be named U Street. In 1859 Dr. J.C. Hawthorne started the private Oregon Hospital there. It soon started to specialize in the treatment of mental illness, and in 1862 it became Oregon Hospital for the Insane, the first such facility in the state. By 1873 18-20 percent of the population of East Portland worked there, and U Street was renamed Asylum Street. Most patients were committed by the state, and the hospital was almost exclusively funded by Dr. Hawthorne’s lucrative state contract. His friends in high places supported him until well in the 1880’s, when the state mental hospital moved to Salem. The distastefully named Asylum Road became Hawthorne Avenue. What upstanding citizen would want to buy a house on Asylum Road ? In the San Francisco Call of June 16, 1897 it says Fenstermacher lived on 14 acres he owned in the Seldon and Hiantha Murray Donation Land Claim, which means he grew his fruit somewhere on what is now Hawthorne Boulevard between 20th and 38th Street. Those are the 14 acres sold by the state in June 1888. In the lawsuit the various witnesses for the plaintiffs testified that they knew Jonas or John Fenstermacher in Pennsylvania or in the military, and that he had told them the various details of his life. Attorney Dolph argued that the case was completely based on hearsay, because the witnesses had all their information from Fenstermacher himself, who was now deceased. The state argued that there indeed was a Jonas Fenstermacher in Pennsylvania, and in the US Army, but it had not been established that this was the same person as the John Fenstermacher who died in Portland. On September 19, 1898 Judge Sears sided with the plaintiffs, and awarded them the fund. One last thing had to be settled. The evidence shows the original amount of the escheated assets to have been $ 15,165.62, but that the state has paid out $ 1,995.05 for costs and expenses necessarily incurred in successfully defending two certain actions brought to recover the fund by parties claiming to be entitled thereto. Attorney Moreland and the plaintiffs did not like the fact that they had to pay the state for the costs of the failed lawsuits of their relatives, and appealed that part of the ruling. The Supreme Court of Oregon on January 29, 1900 decided to uphold Judge Sears’ calculations. As in the previous Peter Fenstermacher et al. appeal, the Supreme Court refused to rule on the facts of the case, because “a proceeding of this kind is an action at law, and therefore the findings of the trial court upon controverted facts are not open to review here.” The lawsuits were finally settled. alt_text Thus ends the sad story of Jonas Fenstermacher, who very briefly owned a very small part of the Piedmont Neighborhood, and of the hundreds of relatives who wanted a piece of the estate when he died. 2.9.3 References Morning Oregonian 05/19/1887.

Love. The normal allocation of 160 acres was doubled because both husband and wife applied, and doubled again because they arrived in Oregon in 1849. The copy of the patent is hard to read, so I have transcribed what I could decipher below. Whereas there has been deposited in the GENERAL LAND OFFICE of the UNITED STATES a Certificate numbered Fourteen hundred and eighty-four of the Register and Receiver at Oregon City, Oregon whereby it appears that under the provisions of the act of Congress approved the 27th day of September 1850, entitled “An Act to create the office of Surveyor General of the Public Lands in Oregon and to provide for the survey and to make donations to settlers of the said public lands” and the legislation supplemental thereto the claim of Lewis Love and his wife Nancy M. Love of Multnomah County, Oregon, Notification No 293 has been established to a donation of one section of six hundred and forty acres of land, that the same has been surveyed and designated as Claim number forty-one, being parts of sections ten, eleven, fourteen, and fifteen in Township one North, of Range one East, according to the Official Plat of Survey retained to the GENERAL LAND OFFICE by the SURVEYOR GENERAL being ??? and described as follows to wit: beginning at a point fourteen chains East of the South West corner of ??? section ten and running thence North sixty-seven chains and eighty links; thence South twenty-two degrees East eighty-eight chains and seventy links; thence South sixty-two chains and ten links; thence North eighty-nine degrees and thirty minutes West; and thence North twenty-one chains to the point of beginning in the district of Sandy, subject to sale at Oregon City, Oregon, containing six hundred and thirty-five acres and seventy-eight hundredth of an acre. Now know ye that the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA in consideration of the premises and in conformity with the provisions of the act aforesaid HAVE GIVEN AND GRANTED and by those presents DO GIVE AND GRANT unto the said Lewis Love and to his heirs the East half and unto his wife the said Nancy M. Love and her heirs the West half of the tract of land above described to have and to hold the said tract, with the appurtenances, unto the said Lewis Love and his wife Nancy M. Love and to their heirs and assigns forever, ??? respective ??? as aforesaid. The northwest corner of the parcel makes a 78˚ angle, and the south line is very slightly skewed at an angle of 89˚30’. Check out Bryant Street on modern maps of Portland, because Bryant follows the south boundary of the Lewis Love DLC. The distance between Morgan and Bryant is larger at Martin Luther King Jr Blvd than it is at the I5 Freeway. alt_text 2.10.2 Sales In his long career Lewis Love bought many parcels of land, in downtown Portland, in various outlying Oregon counties, and in Clark County, Washington. He also sold these properties, often making a large profit. But his original donation land claim remained intact, in fact it grew somewhat over the years. He did not sell, and he seemed to fiercely protect its integrity. But after his death in 1903, everything went pear shaped. He had made a will in 1899 (see De Leeuw, 2018). His heirs were prohibited by the will from selling their shares of the estate until 1907, but they immediately started to convert land to money. In fact, some of them sold their claims to the estate that were defined in the will, even if it was not executed yet. To understand the division of the land the will indicates the parcel was about 750 acres. Initially the executors of the will T. T. Struble and Philo Holbrook tried to sell the whole tract. It is unclear to me if they were required to do this by law, or if the heirs had decided it is easier to divide up money than it is to divide up land. In any case, here are two ads from the Oregonian of March 31, 1903 and March 1, 1907. alt_text alt_text Now $ 500 per acre would make the tract $ 375,000 – a gigantic amount of money in 1903. The usual inflation calculators show that this would be about ten million dollars in 2018. But on the other hand, those ten million dollars in 2018 will barely buy you 25 houses in the modern Piedmont neighborhood. Selling the whole 750 acres as a single tract did not work, and the executors had to divide up the land. Now I am not sure how this was actually done, but given the final results I can make a fair guess. Lewis and Nancy Love had four surviving children (Fred, Lewis, Green, Mary) and two deceased children with progeny (William, Malinda). Thus the estate was divided in six parts, with the surviving children getting one sixth each, and the grandchildren dividing up the two other sixths that would have come to their parents. If we ignore the other real estate and the personal property, then each sixth would be about 120 acres. This corresponds with the six vertical strips of about 120 acres that were later platted and subdivided from west to east as Fairview (from Minnesota to Albina), Swinton (from Albina to Kerby), Lovewood plus Green C. Love Addition (from Kerby to Vancouver), Loveleigh (from Vancouver to Rodney), Love’s Addition (From Rodney to Union), and El Tovar (from Union to Eight Street). So that’s our model, which is probably approximate. Six vertical tracts going to the six heirs, with the two sets of grandchildren acting as a single heir. My next job is to find the deeds that either verify or falsify this model. Because there were many heirs, and because inheritances tend to make people greedy and irrational, there are many deeds to be considered. I have not found them all yet, but I’ll continue to make a valiant effort. I will also try to indicate which piece of the original DLC was sold and to whom, all the way up to the final plat. Let’s start with the eastern strip, which is not in Piedmont but in Woodlawn (and Sunderland). On August 12, 1908 Lewis P. Love and his wife Mattie M. Love sold the 48.19 acres bounded by Union Avenue to the west, Bryant Street to the south, Eight Street to the east, and the ONR railroad tracks to the North to Elias Brong from $ 72.000. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XV6thcd7zVAzSDaZFUUhPxiCqWBwIX69 These 48.19 acres were platted by the Brong-Steele Company immediately after the sale on August 28, 1908 as the El Tovar subdivision. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FxOMQX-zJeRPSWraRJrK9SQ0oPhXr_TB On October 29, 1910 they sold the remaining 52.26 acres north of the railroad tracks to the same Elias Brong for a nominal amount of $ 10. ($ 83,616) https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Rm-Aufg_88SThyr3b6l3gRZ7DVnQs_Px The second strip, from Union on the east to Rodney on the west was the part that came to Mary Stafford. On August 8, 1908 the plat for Love’s Addition was filed. This was for the 46.18 acres south of the railroad, with of course Bryant as the southern boundary. The Stafford branch of the Love family did not sell to a developer first, but they themselves became the developers. The plat was filed by Mary C. Stafford, her surviving children, and their husbands/wives if available. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DsMlduu7Bq29woFq-Ox95e1FHD3I0Ce_ On October 28, 1916 the same Mary C. Stafford and children recorded the plat for the northern half of the strip, from the railway track to the Slough, as an extension of Love’s Addition. Not much of that tract was actually developed as intended, because Love’s Addition north of the railway tracks remained mainly industrial. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CUQpe_6FmaXTIgj7CC4f9rb_EjN1xdQe If we travel west, to the third strip, matters become slightly more complicated. The 50.49 acres bounded by Rodney, Vancouver, Bryant, and the railroad tracks were sold to Elias Brong, basically by the children of William Love for $ 63,075. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ba8lg6Sn6Bl1ty6DYqCNLTl92xZuPL6Q More precisely, the sellers are Ulysses G. Love (unmarried), D. J. Buckley (unmarried), Lewis W. Love and Alice R. Love his wife, Charles W. Love and Elizabeth Love his wife, and Frank P. Love and Annie Love his wife. If we compare this with the surviving sons mentioned in the will of Lewis Love, we see that John A. Love is missing. The reason is simple. John A. Love and Catherine A. Love his wife sold their 1/30 share of the Lewis Love estate to D. J. Buckley for $ 10,000 on June 18, 1904. They couldn’t wait until 1908. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CUQpe_6FmaXTIgj7CC4f9rb_EjN1xdQe Those 50.49 acres were platted by Brong-Steele as Loveleigh on March 27, 1908. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DkSAk09dy4P8WEnhIk2DoUidFOkjt3ZD The section of 101.48 acres between Vancouver and Rodney, north of the railroad and south of the Slough, was sold by the same parties to the Columbia Trust Company on March 8, 1909, for the nominal sum of $ 10. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1A1veUIZ5Dfc-v9qmb2l546hKLePjX-n6 Going further west to strip number four brings us to the land inherited by the reverend Green C. Love. 2.11 Homesteaders: Lewis Love and Family alt_text alt_text Lewis Love 1818-1903 and Nancy M. Love (Griffith) 1820-1892 in 1873 2.11.1 Introduction Writing a chapter about Lewis Love is somewhat daunting. He had a long, rich, and active life. If I had enough time and energy left I could probably write a 250-page book about Lewis Love and his immediate family, but I have many more Piedmont history chapters to write. I am just mentioning the potential Lewis Love book to show how much happened during his life, and how much material there still is. Even for my more limited project there is much more documentation I have to go through than for Ulery, Fenstermacher, Smith, and Howe combined. Love had many children, who largely remained in the Portland area, and generated many newspaper items of their own. He had much more land in his donation land claim than the others, because he was married and arrived in Oregon early. He also lived longer, and he was involved in multiple minor and major lawsuits, which also generated a lot of coverage. So this promises to be a rather long chapter, with much biographical detail. There will be separate sections on the members of his immediate family, his wife and children. Because this book concentrates on real property transactions, we only discuss the children, because after the death of Lewis Love they almost immediately got rid of his land. The grandchildren were no longer involved in selling tracts and subdividing neighborhoods. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, not much is known about his wife and the daughters. Their assigned role in life was to marry young, get a lot of children, and “keep house”. There are some minor exceptions, but generally it’s patriarchy throughout. One more introductory remark. The modern Piedmont neighborhood tends to be identified with the original Piedmont subdivision of 1888. For example, the motto of the Piedmont Neighborhood Association is taken from the brochures of the Investment Company, the logo is either the bandstand in Peninsula Park, right next to original Piedmont, or the water tower that the Investment Company built for the Piedmont subdivision. But the part of the Piedmont subdivision that is in the Piedmont neighborhood is only about ten to fifteen percent of the neighborhood area, while the Lewis Love DLC is at least half of the Piedmont neighborhood. A pretty good case could be made for changing the name of the Piedmont neighborhood to the Love neighborhood, or simply to Lewis Love. Of course it is true that the southern part of the neighborhood, below Bryant, is among the oldest parts and was certainly initially the most affluent. But one of the main reasons for this is that Lewis Love did not sell or develop any of his acreage, and that development north of Bryant only started more than twenty years after Piedmont was platted and developed. In those twenty years North Portland built the Swift meat packing plant, and many other industries, and the people working in those plants needed housing. That created demand for a different type of housing than the homes for comparatively well-off people fleeing the rowdy and immoral West Side. To some extent this chapter tries to remedy an unfortunate situation. The Sunday Oregonian of January 7, 2008 had a nice article about Lewis Love in John Terry’s Oregon’s Trails series with the title: _Pioneer’s name all but forgotten in public domain. _Here it is: https://drive.google.com/open?id=14LskwYekRmv3OS0hftxd73F-VIn6Hxwe Although the piece is useful, it has several errors. As we have seen, the southern boundary of Love’s property in North/Northeast Portland was not Lombard but Bryant. Although there may not be a great deal of Love memorabilia left standing downtown, the names of the Piedmont subdivisions certainly have a lot of Love in them. I guess John Terry, together with the rest of the Oregonian, tends to pay more attention to the other side of the Willamette. This also explains why Lewis Love was “all but forgotten”. Portland history, like most local history, tends to concentrate on the people who started living in the town center, were active in public life, flaunted their riches, donated stuff, and advertised their name. Lewis Love amassed his fortune in a rather unspectacular and fairly modest way. Although he was active on the west side, and actually lived on First Street and Front Street for a long time, his most important accomplishments were in Washington Territory, on the Columbia River, and in North and Northeast Portland. And events in those areas were inherently less visible than those on the west side. His children stayed on the east side and platted and developed his huge land holdings there. Although it is true that Lewis Love does not feature prominently in Portland history books such as the ones by McCall, Abbott, and Lansing, his name does live on in the names of the subdivisions Loveleigh, Lovewood, Love’s Addition, and the Green C. Love Addition. I hope this chapter shows how Captain Love’s trajectory, starting poor and becoming rich, was ultimately based on huge swatches of stolen lands given away by the US government. The purpose of this generosity was to attract settlers from the East to replace Native Americans and to finalize discovery and manifest destiny claims. Within this framework, which is of course basically corrupt, Lewis Love was a remarkable man. He saw and took opportunities that were offered to white people at the time, creating and abandoning businesses when appropriate, never being discouraged by disaster, using and misusing the law, and having a truly incredible amount of physical and mental power and energy. And, throughout, he saw and emphasized the value of land. Holding on for more than 50 years to his 700 acres in North and Northeast Portland, and not selling any of it during his lifetime, was definitely a prudent decision. And above all it was very family-friendly, because ultimately it greatly benefited all his children and grandchildren. 2.11.2 Life In November 1899 Captain Lewis Love sat down with his granddaughter Harriet LaVelle Peacher and dictated a manuscript with the details of his trek across the plains from Missouri to Oregon, and about his subsequent activities and enterprises in Oregon and Washington. There are nine nicely cleaned up and retyped pages. A second seventeen-page manuscript, by Captain Love’s great-granddaughter Clara Love Stone goes through Captain Love’s manuscript and provides many additional details and references. These manuscripts are the holy grail of Lewis Love scholarship. I will refer to them in this chapter as the Love Manuscript and the Love Commentary, with a capital M and a capital C. They are reproduced here in total, because we will use them as the starting point for much of the chapter. As you will see, a great deal of attention is paid to Love’s travels on the Oregon Trail, which probably was the most exciting period of his life, although surely not the most profitable one. In the text we have incorporated the underlined and numbered references to the Love Commentary by Ms. Stone, which follows the Love Manuscript. 2.11.3 Manuscript of Captain Lewis Love (Commenced writing Nov. 1, 1899 and finished Nov. 29, 1899. Dictated to his _granddaughter, Harriet LaVelle Peacher )_ _PREFACE_ _Captain Love was born in New York, Chautauqua Co., June 12, 1818. After_ _living there till he was 15 years of age he moved to Fox River Co., Illinois_ _in the year 1833. From there he moved to Missouri in 1845 and crossed the_ _plains to come West in 1849. His mother was part Pennsylvania Dutch and part_ _Yankee; she was born in New York and her name before she was married was Jane_ _Demont (deMott). She was the mother of 6 boys and 2 girls all of which are_ _dead (Nov. 1899) except Captain Lewis Love._ _Mrs. Love, Captain Lewis Love&#39;s wife was born in Tennessee, near a little_ _town called Spy and moved to Illinois in 1833 where she met Mr. Love and they_ _were married in 1836. Mrs. Love&#39;s Mother&#39;s name was Edwards before she was_ _married and Mrs. Love&#39;s name was Griffith. Her Mother was from Tennessee. She_ _was born before the Revolution and has been dead 70 years._ _There was born to Captain Lewis Love and wife six boys and 2 girls, namely_ _Mary C. Love, Melinda Love, Green Love, Lewis Love, Fred Love, William Love,_ _Jeremiah and Joseph beside four children which they raised but never adopted._ _There was three boys drowned, namely William Love and --- and --- (Names_ _not given in the manuscript for the latter two)_ _CIRCUMSTANCES CROSSING PLAINS_ _The train which Captain Lewis Love crossed the plains in started from_ _&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Lawrence Co., Mo&lt;/span&gt;. (1), and when they got thirty miles north of Ft. Scott,_ _they came to high water called the Osage River._ _There was only three families together at that time, so they went to_ _work putting in timbers to make a raft to cross on about 2:00 P.M. Two_ _Cherokee Indians rode up and asked us what we were doing. They were on_ _their way to the gold fields in California. We told them we were putting_ _in timbers to build a raft to cross the high water, so they said for us to_ _turn our teams out and their train would come up that evening with 35_ _wagons and 85 men. So we waited till next morning, then went to work_ _building the raft._ _We got it all together in good shape in a stream called &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Sugar Creek (2)&lt;/span&gt;, this_ _being backwater from the Osage River. We floated down to the Osage so as_ _to be able to cross both streams at once. There we found the river to be_ _very swift, too much so to hold against the current. Then we wondered how_ _we was going to cross. Finally Capt, Love suggested that we take&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt; grapevines (3)&lt;/span&gt;_ _and make ropes. Two or three of the Indians kept interfering till the main_ _body drove the others off and told them to stay until it was time for them_ _to cross. Capt. Love took one man with him and they pounded the vines till_ _they could be beat to make a cable. They made a cable to reach a quarter_ _of a mile and forked it down near the raft to keep it from swinging around_ _so as to pull across straight. We then swam over and took ropes to pull_ _us in the direction we wanted to go. We put one wagon on the raft at a_ _time and each trip the raft would sink knee deep till we struck the swift-_ _est part of the river, then the raft would rise on top and float from there_ _over. We commenced taking things across at 2:00 P.M. and that night at_ _10:00 P.M. everything was over safe. From that on the Cherokees became so_ _much attached to me they would ride three or four miles to see me._ _Soon afterwards Cholera set in and it was not uncommon for four or five_ _cases to be reported in camp, the Cherokees being about the heaviest suf-_ _ferers according to the number, and they died off very fast._ _The Ninth Regiment that crossed the plains that year took them in tow and_ _kept them for several hundred miles until they were able to take care of_ _the teams themselves, then they were discharged. And the last I saw of_ _them was on South Pass in the Rocky Mts. They rode past us four miles and_ _drove back to bid me farewell._ _Not long after we left the Osage River we came to a bluff where we had to_ _let the wagons down by means of trees and ropes. Some of the trees had_ _gashes cut in them fully two inches from letting down so many wagons. We_ _had not traveled far when an axle broke in one of the wagons so we went_ _along up the canyon a ways till we came to some ash trees. We hewed a_ _piece of ash down and made another axle._ _One morning while we were camping at a place called Potowatammy, I went_ _out to hunt up the cattle. When I found them there were 41 missing. The_ _word came that Indians were seen driving them away up the road, The man_ _that was with me wanted to go that way to find them. I told him, No, it_ _was a hook (hoax) to keep us from finding them. I told him I was too well_ _acquainted with the Indians to believe they would steal my cattle. So we_ _struck across the plains about four miles to a high ridge which had quite_ _a stream of water at the foot of it. There I saw three squaws riding across_ _the plains. I hailed them, and as I could talk a little of their language,_ _I asked them if they had seen any cattle. So they motioned up over the_ _ridge where there was three men herding them and just ready to start off_ _with them. I wanted to know of them what they were doing with those cattle,_ _and they said they was sent back by a train about four miles ahead to gather_ _them up. I told them it was no such a thing for my cattle were all branded_ _and there was the brand to show for itself. They had 13 head of oxen of_ _mine which would have left me only one to work. When we got to Ft. Carney_ _(Kearney) I took a man by the name of Miller in the train to assist. The_ _rule was that two men was to stand guard every night and when it came my_ _turn he never would let me go but he would take my place. When we got_ _pretty well to Ft. Laramie there was five men and a wagon came into the_ _train. One of the men was a great big stout fellow and to let him tell_ _it he could whip all the Indians on the plains. They took a notion one_ _day, quite a number, that he was a coward and along towards night he was_ _pointing out how many pony tracks there was. So they thought they would_ _play a joke on him. It was his night to be on duty, and of course if any_ _Indians came around they knew he would shoot them. One old man in their_ _wagon called &quot;Pap&quot; on account of his age told him he had been an old front-_ _iersman and would like to load his gun for him. So it was loaded with a_ _paper wad, After supper the two men went out on guard. The second man had_ _been informed of the joke so he was all ready for them. A while later five_ _men went out, three of whom had guns, and went around in behind the men and_ _two of them commenced patting on their knees to draw his attention. His_ _bravery left him very suddenly and, making the best speed possible for the_ _camp, told them the Indians were after him and he had come for help. Next_ _morning quite a crowd gathered around in one wagon, and were talking about_ _the Indians&#39; attack and one person asked him how many Indians he really_ _thought there was. He said there was 25 or 30 in front and they occupied a_ _piece of ground the shape of a flatiron, and back of this number their heads_ _stuck up as thick as they could be._ _After we crossed South Platte, apast Ft. Laramie, two or three days&#39; ride,_ _we stopped to noon one day. While we were eating, two men came back a-_ _horseback. They were in haste and wanted us to drive on as they wanted help._ _The time came for the train to start and several more trains drove up and a_ _German man belonging to one of the trains was very much excited over the re-_ _port of the Indians and went on to tell how they would kill us. I went up_ _to him and put my hand on his shoulder and told him he must not talk that way_ _because he was frightening the women and children. He says, &quot;You are right&quot;,_ _and you could hardly hear another word out of him after that. When we got_ _straightened around ready to start, we traveled about two miles, when we_ _found we had to turn around and come back about five miles. We started down_ _Ash Canyon. After going down some distance the same two men came riding_ _back further up on the offside of the teams, yelling for the women and_ _children to get into the wagons, that the Indians were advancing. The men_ _reported 1500 to 2000 Indians. They came on around where I was and I stepped_ _out and told them the same as I told the German man, and if they didn&#39;t stop_ _I would knock them off their horses. As soon as they passed on, I took my_ _gun and went to see what there was over the hill. ‘Iwo women went with me._ _We went to the top of the hill. There we stopped and estimated about 75 or_ _80 Indians out of the 1500 or 2000. ‘Then we went back down the hill and met_ _our teams. We then reported the number of Indians. A great many would not_ _believe us on account of the large number being reported before. We then_ _drove on out to the mouth of the canyon, having about 80 horsemen in front,_ _well-armed. When we got down to where the Indians were we rode on down_ _amongst them and found everything very peaceful after all the scare. It_ _was a remnant of the Sioux tribe who had just been engaged in a battle with_ _a tribe called the Blackfeet. I wanted to know of those fellows after the_ _trains had stopped, why they had made so much fuss about the Indians. They_ _said one Indian made a mark across the road in the dust. Those were the_ _first Indians we had seen since leaving the Potowatammy tribe, so many_ _Indians had left the trail on account of the Whites and we only saw a few_ _buffalo._ _Close to Independence Rock, which was literally covered with names, quite a_ _number of people had gathered together. One train of 52 wagons and car-_ _riages drove up which took passengers and freight. That train held a meet~_ _ing and decided to throw out 1,000 pounds of freight, some offering a dol-_ _lar a pound to get it hauled through. They went to work unloading the freight._ _Amongst other things there was quite a large quantity of powder. They took_ _it and poured it in a circle around quite a large piece of ground out of the_ _kegs; then put a fuse to it and burnt the circle in that way, and a great_ _many articles that was supposed to have been thrown out were shipped in other_ _Wagons._ _After that we came to a great many places where wagons and buggies were left_ _standing different places on the plains. One instance I unhitched from a_ _2-horse wagon and left it standing with the cover on. I asked the people if_ _they objected to my leaving mine and taking the other one. They said no, I_ _was welcome to it, so I changed the load and left my wagon standing with the_ _cover on._ _It was a very common thing for the oxen to get sore feet. So we would take_ _a piece of skin from a dead ox and sew it around the sore feet to keep the_ _sand from getting into them. Nothing more of much importance occurred till_ _we struck the Black Hills. Two men had gone ahead to find a camping place_ _at the foot of the Black Hills, and when they got there they reported no_ _grass to be found -- nothing but sagebrush. They said we would have to tie_ _our cattle up with nothing to eat. I got on my mule and asked if any man_ _would go with me to hunt grass. It was in the P.M. We struck out for a_ _high rocky ridge. When we got about 2/3 of the way to it, the Irishman_ _would not go any further. He said there was no use. I went about a mile_ _and then had to get off my muie and walk, it was so rocky. I went on over_ _the ridge and down to the creek bottom and found some grass and brush, etc._ _I went back and took the cattle over, which gave them 2/3 of a feed. A_ _watchman stayed on the hill overnight. Next morning I went over with the_ _rest to drive the cattle back and then I told them about there being quite_ _a number of Indians camping along the creek. They thought I hadn&#39;t been_ _down there, but after a while they found the camps as I had told then._ _Then we drove on a half day and stopped to noon and a man by the name of_ _Dotworthy and myself went down on the ridges to see if we could find any-_ _thing to shoot. There we picked up a chunk which afterwards proved to be_ _gold. We looked at.it awhile and then threw it down and left it. No doubt_ _the piece was worth $1000.00._ _When we reached Bare River Hills, there we saw the first snow and straw-_ _berry blossoms stick up to the edge of the snow. When we got down to Snake_ _River, we found plenty of Indians. I used to practice lifting with them._ _I had one wagon that was pretty heavily loaded. I would turn my back to_ _the wheel and take hold of the spokes and then motion for some of the big_ _Indians to come and lift it. But I never found but one that could lift it._ _Then the Indians would point to me and say I was so much stronger than they_ _were. When we came to Salmon Falls the Indians came to us every day and_ _wanted to swap salmon for shirts. It didn&#39;t make any difference how ragged_ _they were just so they could get them. Sometimes they would get a little_ _sulky because we wouldn&#39;t trade with them. We traveled all the way down on_ _the South side of Snake River and the first country we found that appeared_ _to be muddy was along Powder River. When we started over Grand Round Valley,_ _I thought it the most beautiful country we had found yet. There I saw the_ _largest bunch of Indian ponies I had ever seen. There were fully 2000 in_ _the number._ _When we started up into the Blue Mountains there for the first time we came_ _into tall timber, and crossing Grand Round (Ronde) River you could see salmon_ _darting in every direction. After crossing the first mountain we found some_ _very rich land. When we crossed the first mountain before we crossed the_ _river there was about a dozen Indians traveled with us for two weeks. I had_ _a spring wagon with me, which the Indians had never seen before. Every night_ _they would deposit a package of some kind in that wagon and would remove it_ _again every morning, and would talk about the wagon and appeared to be very_ _much pleased. They would camp at night and build a fire, and lay two tent_ _poles parallel on the ground; then they would form on each side and sit down_ _with sticks in their hands and commence singing. The first Indian would have_ _a stick sharpened to a point at each end, just long enough so he could hold_ _it in his hands without it being seen. Then he would throw it from one hand_ _to the other and the one that guessed which hand the stick was in got the_ _stick and repeated the same thing. This was their way of gambling. They_ _seemed very much delighted to think they could travel along with us. We_ _traveled over the Columbia River near the mouth of the Umatilla while they_ _were with us._ _There was one man and his mother in the train, and one night we camped on_ _Willow Creek. This man&#39;s name was Morgan and he was in the habit of picking_ _up ail the chains, picks, shovels, etc. he came across until his team was_ _completely broken down. We had to pull his wagon up all the hills, so that_ _night we appointed a committee, I being one of them, to inform him that he_ _must throw out some of those things or we would not help him any more. He_ _refused to do so. Then I told his mother to get into my wagon, and if I_ _reached my destination she would too. She said no, it would be too much_ _trouble. Then a Mr. Person spoke up and said she could ride in his wagon_ _part of the time. She refused the second offer so we had to proceed without_ _them._ _By this time provisions were getting scarce and we had no time to waste. Im-_ _mediately after we left them we came to a mountain that took 14 yoke of oxen_ _to pull up one wagon. The side of the mountain was full of Indians, some on_ _foot and some on horses, watching us get up the mountain. After we all got_ _to the top we proceeded on our journey, and before night Morgan passed us_ _driving his oxen without the wagon. He had sent his mother and provisions_ _and other things with Indians down to the mouth of the Deschutes River. When_ _we reached there a man by the name of Coile went down on the bank of the_ _river and found the old lady in a little tent with the bedding and everything_ _else she had left was on the forward wheels of the wagon. He took her in his_ _wagon and hauled her to The Dalles where she found her son._ _Deschutes River was quite deep and when we crossed the Indians acted as_ _guides. We put a rope around the forward oxens&#39; horns, as the route was_ _somewhat crooked. After I crossed another team started and it got about_ _half way across and refused to go any farther. I got on my mule and took_ _my good yoke of leaders and drove in and hitched them on ahead and pulled_ _them out. In that way we had quite a time getting the oxen turned around_ _in the water as it was very swift. The people in the wagon were so dizzy_ _they could hardly sit in the seat. The Old Methodist National Bldg. was_ _still standing when we reached The Dalles. But there was no white people_ _except one Catholic priest amongst the Indians. There we left our wagons_ _and hired Indians to take us to the Cascades in canoes._ _We went on down the river and got a small flat boat and brought it to the_ _foot of the Cascades, and packed everything on our backs to this boat, the_ _distance being about 5 miles. We then went on down in the boat which leaked_ _so bad we had to keep three or four men bailing all the time to keep it from_ _sinking._ _At the foot of Cape Horn Mts. is where the last bite of bread was eaten in_ _the train. I had been providing provisions for part of the members in the_ _train for nearly 300 miles. That night we came to where we could get plenty_ _to eat again. The first house we came to after crossing the plains was at_ _Washougal and the next one we came to was at Ft. Scott. The man&#39;s name was_ _&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;White &lt;/span&gt;(4)._ _When we got to the Cascades we learned how the Indians made their beds. The_ _shore was very rocky so they would throw out the rocks from a place big_ _enough to lay in and make the sand level and that was their resting place._ _Before leaving The Dalles I hired an Indian at my own expense to drive the cat-_ _tle down the trail as I had about 1/3 of the stock in the train. We crossed_ _the cattle about 10 miles below the Cascades and next day we landed at Cas._ _with stock._ _The next winter I went to work at a sawmill owned by a man named &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Parker&lt;/span&gt; (5) about_ _mile and a half from where we landed. He paid me $5.00 per day and I agreed_ _to work that winter for him. A few days later I was offered work at &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;another&lt;/span&gt;_ _&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;mill at Milwaukie&lt;/span&gt; (6) at $7.00 per day. But as I had promised to work that_ _winter, I stuck to my job. After we were at Parker&#39;s a few days a man and_ _myself took a skift (skiff?) and went to Vancouver for provisions. We got_ _plenty of flour and 30 pounds of pork from soldiers’ rations. A barrel of_ _thin syrup and a little butter so strong that it cured me from eating butter._ _We got the flour from the Hudson Bay Co. six miles above Vancouver. After_ _we left there a heavy wind came up and while we was crossing the river the_ _water kept splashing in the boat, and the other man became frightened. He_ _was pulling and I was steering and he quit, so I said, &quot;Pull, you devil,_ _pull, or we will go down}&quot; So he pulled like a good fellow till we reached_ _the bank. Then we pulled on up near the bank till we got to Washougal._ _After we passed there a little ways the river became so swift that two In-_ _dians had to get in and help us out. One got on each side and pulled us_ _over the worst part. Then we proceeded to where we was going without any_ _help._ _There was only two men in the country that had any stock before we came there._ _One was Mr. Parker and the other an old Hudson Bay fellow that came to Van-_ _couver in 1824. They had drove their cattle off into the rushes over Cape_ _Horn Mts., and immediately afterwards there came a two-foot snow. The river_ _froze over and we had nothing to live on, but that flour and syrup that winter._ _Although I had five men boarding with me but they was glad to get what we did._ _We had bread and molasses for breakfast, and the reverse for dinner and supper._ _In the spring I moved in a little log house joining my &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;farm on Columbia Slough&lt;/span&gt; (7)_ _and soon after we all took the Mountain or Camp Fever, and also ran out of_ _provisions, yet we had good friends. The year before we moved there, there_ _was a good crop of potatoes raised on the place, and that year there was a_ _few volunteer potatoes came up. Our friends, the &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;wood rats&lt;/span&gt; (8), would dig them_ _up and bring them in and pile them up in the log cabin and we would steal_ _them from the rats and make our soup of them. This was our living for some_ _time. We had no doctor only from the Hudson Bay Co. and he charged $50.00_ _per trip besides his ferriage which brought his bill to $52.00. Between him_ _and the wood rats we weathered it through._ _ _ _My farm was then occupied by a man by the name of Webb. He wanted me to buy_ _the place on account of him going to the mines at Snake River. He was almost_ _a total stranger and wanted $1000.00 for the place and stock, which consisted_ _of two yoke of oxen and 3 cows. I finally made a deal with him. I paid $300_ _down and gave him my note for $700 payable in 18 months. After the bargain_ _was closed and the note given, he went out and dug up a good-sized bucket_ _full of money and wanted me to take care of it and also the note I had given_ _him. I told him &quot;No,&quot; and he urged me so that finally I told him I would not_ _like to have anybody know it was about the house. He said I was the only one_ _he would like to keep it and that no one would ever know from him that I had_ _it. The money consisted of Mexican dollars and gold coins. The gold was in_ _$8.00 and $16.00 pieces called single loons and double loons. He said that_ _if he never came back I would be that much better off. I did not see him any_ _more for 18 months, although the mines he spoke of had never been discovered._ _Soon after that Capt. Banburgan and Bradfords above the Cascades brought emi-_ _gration down on a boat to the Cascades and took cattle for pay, and bought_ _also a large number of cattle and sent them down for me to sell, which gave_ _me something of a start. I also took jobs of work, times being good. The_ _old settlers had been to the mines and came back with quite a little money,_ _They being too good to work after making a fine start. The first summer I_ _cleared $8.25 per day outside of my commissions on sales. Lumber at that_ _time was worth $100.00 per thousand feet, and I went to work hauling lumber_ _from &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Will&#39;s Mill&lt;/span&gt; (6) to the river. When I went to work on Monday, I would take_ _a cedar saw log on my wagon and get it sawed and Saturday when I went home_ _I would buy a little more lumber. I was in need of a house very bad, so I_ _went to work and hewed out sills and studding, and cut white fir timber and_ _made clab boards and shaved them for siding. When I got it up and painted_ _very few people ever noticed the difference from sawed lumber. At that time_ _it was the best locking house in the country. I spent a great deal of ny_ _time boring holes in burnt down trees and burning them up to clear a place_ _to live on. After I had burnt off a great deal of timber in that way, I_ _took a notion to cut the timber in saw logs and bring it to Portland, which_ _consisted of about 15 or 20 buildings at that time. It was expressed along_ _the river that I was a big fool for trying to get out saw logs when there_ _wasn&#39;t a boat on the river to tow with. But I had quite a number of oxen._ _I thought I could put the logs in the Slough and raft them as cheap as I_ _could burn them._ _There came a high water the next summer, and I had got in about 300,000 ft._ _and started them for Portland. We kept close around Gattens Point and went_ _out into the Willamette opposite Sauvies Island. Before starting I went to_ _Vancouver and got four old government tents, put up masts on the rafts and_ _stayed them with lines and stretched these tents up for sails. In a little_ _over four hours we landed in Portland. Soon after this there was quite a_ _number of other fools in the same business. Logging was carried on all_ _along the Slough. I then took a contract for quite a large number of logs,_ _the pay of which was to be part sawing and part money. When I got almost_ _ready to start the logs to Portland, I received a word that the parties were_ _broke. So I came to Portland and went to &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Mr. Mills the contractor&lt;/span&gt; (9) and told_ _him I heard he was broke, and told him I could not make the contract on_ _those conditions. Then I went back and got my logs ready and brought them_ _to Portland. So he offered to let me run the mill a month free. I told_ _him I would not start it for a month&#39;s run at all. He then wanted to sell_ _me the mill. I think I made about four bargains with him before he would_ _stand to it. I finally &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;bought the mill&lt;/span&gt; (10) to save myself on the logs, the_ _raft being fully 3/4 of a mile long. I ran the mill a while, then &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;sold out&lt;/span&gt;_ _&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;mill&lt;/span&gt; (10) and logs, there being $6,000 due me. They kept insisting for me to_ _wait longer and longer for the money, till &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;I waited six years&lt;/span&gt; (10) and had to_ _take my pay in greenbacks which were only worth 50¢ on the dollar._ _Before there was any steamers here and also before this logging contract,_ _I took up a contract to bring up logs in the winter time. I think they_ _were to be at Portland some time in January. I was not much acquainted_ _with currents here and during this time there came a raise of about four_ _or five feet in the Willamette, and I first thought I was not going to be_ _able to get the logs to Portland. I came in and told the parties I didn&#39;t_ _think I could quite fulfill my promise on account of the raise in the_ _river. So they said they would take them any time I could get them here._ _I went and bought a coil and a half of rope and spliced it together and_ _pinned some logs together and made a windlass with a long sweep. I put_ _that in a boat and would go up stream with it the length of the line._ _I put two men on the sweep to make it fast, then go back and take turns at_ _Captain, and one man to coil up the rope. We brought that up the river_ _against a pretty strong current, making about 3/4 of a mile a day, and_ _we reached Portland in 16 days._ _In 1857 I went into the &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;merchandise business&lt;/span&gt; (10A) in Portland and had about_ _the largest retail store in town. After running it some time I became_ _too weakly to attend it, so had to put a man in charge by the name of_ _&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Z. N. Stansbury&lt;/span&gt; (11). He was &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;elected County Treasurer and four of us went&lt;/span&gt;_ _&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;his bonds&lt;/span&gt; (11), and was the defaulter for $ 8,000.00. What I lost in the way_ _of bonds and goods from the store through him made me the loser of about_ _$11,000.00. I was so bad with kidney complaint that I was not able to_ _be out of bed. There was an old doctor by the name of Millard in Port-_ _land well known to the old settlers. He gave me four large doses of_ _calomel within about a week. The last dose commenced operating and I_ _felt my kidneys break loose and drop back about an inch and a half as_ _near as I could tell, and after that I felt like a new man._ _The next spring after this, I think it was in 1859, I fitted up a team _ _and went East of the mountains. I had made arrangements with &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Colonel&lt;/span&gt;_ _&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Rubble&lt;/span&gt; (11A) to take me to The Dalles on his boat, and within about a week after_ _the arrangements were made he sold out to the 0.R.&amp; N.Co., leaving me out_ _in the cold. I then chartered the &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;steamer Independence&lt;/span&gt; (12) and went to the_ _Cascades on her. We camped there two weeks and then proceeded on up the_ _river on a large scow that came down after us. I took a skift (skiff?)_ _and went up and met them and piloted from there down. Then the whole_ _company got very good and offered to take me to The Dalles on most any_ _terms. But I told them I had a conveyance to go up on so we loaded up_ _and went ahead. We had a good breeze and went up quite rapidly. Some_ _of the parties on the scow didn&#39;t understand the navigating of the scow_ _very well and was about to drift her into the rocks on the Washington_ _side. I said a man by the name of Vants to pick up a large 2-ft. plank_ _that was on board and drop it over the side for a lay board to keep her_ _from going onto the rocks and then we soon brought her over to &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Crates&lt;/span&gt;_ _&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt; (13). There we landed and took our stock and teams off. This was about_ _3 miles below The Dalles. Then we traveled at leisure, killing prairie._ _chickens and broiling them on the coals for our living. From Crates_ _Point went on to Walla Walla by land, leaving two wagons at The Dalles_ _and taking two with us. When we arrived at Walla Walla I sold my ox team._ _An Indian agent was there for the purpose of protecting the Indians._ _Across the river was a tent where the white people sold liquor to the_ _Indians. They got the Indians drunk and while they were in that dazed_ _condition they took about 150 or 200 ponies belonging to the Indians,_ _and took them off down the valley and sold them. This is the way the_ _Indians were “protected” there._ _ After we got to Walla Walla there was going to be a &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;flour mill&lt;/span&gt; (13A) raised_ _which belonged to a man by the name of &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Reynolds&lt;/span&gt; (13A). Captain Black and the_ _Indian agent owned the ground for the millsite. So the Indian agent was_ _sent out to invite the men to the raising of the mill. They learned that_ _I was there so they told him not to come back without me, After he found_ _me and I promised to come he said they had a certain duty for me to pe -_ _form. I asked him what it was and he said it was &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;to keep Reynolds in a&lt;/span&gt;_ _&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;good humor&lt;/span&gt; (13A). The men worked out in the hot sun where it was almost un-_ _bearable to be and Mr. Reynolds’ head got so hot that it kept him in a_ _bad humor. He used such abusive language that several of the men quit_ _work and left. So I got the rest of them in a cluster and told them not_ _to get angry at whatever he might say. I soon discovered that he was_ _completely overcome with the heat. So I told him to tell me which way_ _the timbers went and he did, so we soon had the mill up. Although we had_ _no sawed timbers to put in, all being hewed, even the braces and studding,_ _it twisted around so in the hot sun that it’ was hard to get together, but_ _finally it came out all right._ _After that we visited Whitman&#39;s Station, expecting to find the handsomest_ _place in the valley. Although a pretty fair place, the site selected for_ _it was between two hills that came near together right in the Indians’ pass_ way. There was two small pair of millstones dressed out of the rock found _there to put up a small mill where the Indians could get their corn ground._ _Then we returned to Portland and I bought a &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;sawmill at Vancouver&lt;/span&gt; (14), and ex-_ _pected to get the government trade. I kept it for a while but as I charged_ _them the same as I did everybody else I lost their trade. I built a &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;grist&lt;/span&gt;_ _&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;mill to it&lt;/span&gt; (15), and it afterwards &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;burnt&lt;/span&gt; (15) without any insurance. I then built_ _a &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;grist and sawmill where the Hudson Bay Co. had theirs&lt;/span&gt; (16). After running_ _that quite a while (16A), it became flooded with high water and several of us_ _took the notion to go to boating._ _We had a meeting. Myself, Farnsworth and J. D. Biles were elected direct-_ _ors. It was almost all thrown onto my shoulders. So I went out to &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Salmon&lt;/span&gt;_ _&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Creek and rented a mill&lt;/span&gt; (17). I took some men out to dig up the trees with long_ _roots on one side for the bottom timbers of the boat. I would go out one_ _morning and saw till the next evening and bring a load in with me. Farns-_ _worth was a good builder and he wanted to build the boat. Then I had to_ _take charge of the planking under his directions. The O.R.&amp;N. Co. made fun_ _of us, they having two large boats brought here from the East. I made a_ _contract to have the machinery made in Portland. We sent to California for_ _the silders and a few other things, and they were sent up to be finished_ _here. The boiler was too light and before we got through it broke up._ _Then I hired a young man by the day whose name was Dehuff, to finish up the_ _machinery. I got the shop for him to work in, and when it was finished we_ _started to put it in the boat._ _About that time there was an organization of the Peoples&#39; Transportation_ _Co. and we gave them the job of raising the machinery. When it was com-_ _pleted we had the fastest boat on the river. Her name was the &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;E. D. BAKER&lt;/span&gt; (18)._ _Then I commenced getting out timbers for another boat above the Cascades (18A)._ _I hauled the timber to my own mill and sawed it and sent it above the Cas-_ _cades. We finished that boat and called her the IRIS. We also had an-_ _other boat above Deschutes River. At last a dispute arose between the two_ _companies, to see which would have the route on the Columbia. We commenced_ _cutting rates, till we carried passengers from Portland to The Dalles for_ _50¢. Both companies run in debt until Mr. Ladd made a proposition to com-_ _promise. We gave them two steamboats and freight boats on the Columbia,_ _keeping the E.D. BAKER, and they gave us 7 steamboats and freight boats on_ _the Willamette and $10,000 in cash for us to get off of the Columbia and_ _they got off of the Willamette._ _Then we went to work and put in a &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;breakwater at Oregon City&lt;/span&gt; (19) 1½ mi. in_ _length and built a &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;basin at the falls &lt;/span&gt;to run into. Then we built a &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;shoot&lt;/span&gt;_ _&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;to get the freight down to the boats&lt;/span&gt; below. I stayed in that business_ _several years and sold out. After I sold out, stock commenced running down_ _till it got to about 30¢ on the dollar, and then a man by the name of Holla-_ _day bought out the whole thing,_ _I then came to Portland and went into the furniture business. I built me a_ _large store (18B) and had it all quite nicely furnished and the big fire of 1873_ _burnt it up and nearly everything in it, without any insurance. Then I had_ _to recruit a few years before I could do much more. A few years after that_ _I put up some &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;brick buildings &lt;/span&gt;(20) and also some &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;wooden ones&lt;/span&gt;, which I have yet_ _except what I have given to the heirs._ _The year of 1899, Nov. 29, about four months ago, I commenced to build a_ _&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;new residence&lt;/span&gt; (21), and expect to put quite a few men to work making more im-_ _provements in a few days. I have been sought after for some time &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;forging&lt;/span&gt;_ _&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;wills and deeds&lt;/span&gt; (22) for a large amount of my property. I have stood them off_ _so far and some others have stood the penalty of the law._ 2.11.4 Proof of Statements Made in Manuscript of Captain Lewis Love _(Compiled by Clara Love Stone in 1950&#39;s. Reviewed and consolidated by Greg Bettis 1986)_ (1) Excerpt from letter from the State Historical Society of Missouri, Columbia, Mo., _dated October 31, 1952: “Our librarian reports that she is unable to identify_ _the place in Missouri known as Laurence, from which the Love family are said to_ _have started West. There was and is today a Lawrence County in the Southwestern_ _part of the State, but we have no way of knowing whether the county is meant in_ _the reference to the point of departure of the Love family.&quot;_ _Excerpt from a letter from the Missouri Historical Society, St. Louis, Mo.,_ _dated September 20, 1952: &quot;A Missouri state gazetteer of 1860 lists Lawrence,_ _a post office of Oregon County, but it is not included in the gazetteers which_ _we have for 1867 and 1875.

See Book B, P. 407 and Book M., P. 386 - Clark County Courthouse._ _At the present time (1953) it is not generally believed there was a sawmill at_ _Washougal in 1849. The Oregonian (7/4/1903) stated in an article at the time of_ _death of Captain Love: &quot;The family arrived at Parkers Landing in November 1849,_ _and remained there the first winter » Captain Love working in a mill at Washougal.&quot;_ _(6) Bond - Jacob Wills to Benjamin F. Smith, Geo. W. Wills and Wm. Purvine dated May 9, 1860: &quot;Has this day sold to Benj. F, Smith, Geo. W. Wille and Wm. Purvine his saw-_ _mill situated in Multnomah County, etc. etc. Recorded June 6, 1860 on P. 707,_ _Bk B. According to Henry Richardgon of Portlend City Engineers, the above mill was_ _located East of Sellwood, and probably near S. W. McLoughlin Blvd._ _(7) This 640 acre farm, known as the Love Donation Land Claim (Ctf 148k; Notification_ _No. 293) is bounded on the East by 8th St.; on the South by Bryant St.; on the West_ _by Minnesota St.; and extends North beyond Columbia Slough; and it embraces the_ _old Love Cemetery (now known as Columbian Cemetery), several residential sections,_ _a City Park, and many business enterprises, including the National Biscuit Company_ _plant, Vancouver Ave. and Columbia Blvd. Captain Love operated a ferry on this_ _property in the early 1850&#39;s across Love&#39;s Slough as the first step toward a direct_ _route between Portland and Vancouver._ _We learn from Fred Lockley&#39;s &quot;History, etc.&quot; Vol. 1, P. 529: “The first money paid_ _Into the treasury of Multnomah County was $10.00 for a license to run a ferry. The_ _first meeting of the County Commissioners of Multnomah County was on Jan. 17, 1855._ _On April 4, 1855 petition was presented regarding rate of ferriage. It was ordered_ _by the court that Lewis Love be allowed the following rates for ferrying across the_ _Slough at his place, situated between Portland and Switzler&#39;s ferry: for wagon and_ _animal 25¢; man on horseback 10¢; foot passenger 5¢; loose animals 5¢. It also is_ _ordered that he pay a license fee of $5.00 per year. It would certainly seem that if_ _a man paid $2.00 to have himself and team ferried across the Columbia by John Switzler and 25¢ additional to be ferried across the Columbia Slough by Lewis Love, he was paying plenty; but on July 3, 1855, at the first meeting of the new board of County Commissioners, consisting of Samel Farman, Ellis Walker and Dana Powell, application was made by Lewis Love to have a new schedule of charges allowed. The old record of this action reads: “Relative to the application of Lewis Love to run a ferry on the road from Portland to Switzler&#39;s on the Columbia, across the Slough at his place, it was ordered that the following rates be established for the ensuing year: Foot passengers 12½ ¢; horse and mule 12½ ¢; man on horse 25¢; wagon and one horse 37½ ¢; wagon with two horses 50¢.&quot;_ _Excerpt from Oregonian 4/26/1897: &quot;It was he (Capt. Love) who ran that road (main road between Portland and Vancouver) through to the Columbia Slough, and he was supervisor of the road for a long time. It was Capt. Love, by the way, who took the initiatory steps in getting the boundaries of Multnomah County established.&quot; Road Survey No. 36, Bk 1, P. 61 states: &quot;Note of survey of proposed change in road leading from the ferry landing in East Portland (Stark St.) to Love&#39;s ferry on the Columbia River, and known as the Vancouver Road, filed June 25, 1867.&quot;_ _Capt. Love deeded three acres along the west boundary of the farm as a cemetery, which is today known as Columbian Cemetery ( Recorded 1/22/1868 in Bk H, P. 187), making provision in his will for a plot at the northwest corner just outside of the original_ _cemetery with a 2-ft. walkway around it, as the final resting place of himself and his_ _wife Nancy M. Love._ _At the time of Capt. Love&#39;s death in 1903 the farm contained some 767 acres, and ex-_ _tended north to Force&#39;s Lake. The area between the Slough and the OR&amp;N tracks was developed as a farm, with meadows, cultivated areas, orchards, gardens, and some wooded sections, with possible some nine miles of fencing. The portion south of the OR&amp;N tracks was a wooded area, known as Love&#39;s Woods. Thereafter Love&#39;s Woods was platted into the following additions: Fairport (bet. Minnesota and Albina); Swinton (bet. Albina and Kerby); Green C. Love Addition and Lovewood (bet. Kerby and Vancouver Ave.); Loveleigh (bet. Vancouver Ave. and Rodney); Love&#39;s Addition (bet.

They were taken _to the national park service workshop at the site of old Fort Vancouver where_ _Louis Caywood, park service archeologist, will repair them. Later they will_ _be set up in an exhibit of large historical relics. The mill was built on_ _Love&#39;s creek ….._ _The grist stones were sent to Fort Vancouver from Great Britain by ship_ _around South America. They are made of skillfully fitted blocks laid in a_ _base of cement made from coral shipped in from the Hawaiian Islands. The_ _original iron bands which bound them together are still on them and one stone_ _still has its iron core. One of the stones which had lain untended for scores_ _of years broke into sections when it was lifted to the truck. The other stone_ _is in better repair. Both will be restored eventually to working order….._ _Pollard said that with the help of the park service more material will be ex-_ _cavated at sites of other Hudson&#39;s Bay Company posts as well as at Fort Clat-_ _sop, winter camp site of the Lewis &amp; Clark expedition. When arranged the ma-_ _terial will be the largest and most interesting display of early Oregon his-_ _torical relics, he said._ _Unander, who has investigated the history of the stones, said they are 42_ _inches in diameter and cost 28 pounds a pair when made in England. They were_ _assembled and cemented together apparently after reaching Fort Vancouver._ _The stones had been on the original mill site since they were first taken_ _there. Unander, who had owned the property for several years, brought them_ _to the attention of the society and offered them to the historical organiza-_ _tion for preservation.

Bulldozing was promptly begun at the outlet of_ _the mill stream into the Columbia for the purpose of widening and deepening_ _the area for a suitable moorage (garage) for a seaplane and yacht, which proved_ _to be something of an undertaking when they ran into the multitude of laminated_ _and hardened lumber and bark left by the Hudson&#39;s Bay Company, which had in the_ _meantime for the most part rested beneath soil and water. The old mill site is_ _picturesque with its beautiful new homes, removed as it is from the general_ _public with the recent opening of the new Camas-Washougal highway some distance_ _to the North.

His biographical_ _®k@tch (including picture) is on P. 124. |_ _Much has been written about the content of this paragraph, particularly in the_ _Lewis &amp; Dryden Marine History, confirming the story as told by Capt. Love, al-_ _though in no way linking his name with the boating venture. Obviously, however,_ _Lewis Love was associated in this boating venture, and with the Peoples Trans-_ _Portation Company._ _Lewis &amp; Dryden (P. 115): &quot;More new boats were constructed in 1863 than in any_ previous year. That was the year the E. D. Baker and Iris were built. The Baker was the crack boat of the Peoples Transportation Co. fleet and was one of the _fastest sternwheelers that appeared on the Columbia. She was launched at Van-_ _COuver and immediately after completion was put on the Cascades routes….._ _After the two big companies compromised the steamer made a few regular trips on_ _the Willamette and finally sank near Oswego. She was raised afterward but her_ _hull was in poor condition and the engines were removed and placed in the Re-_ _liance and subsequently in the Alice......While her life was brief her good wark_ _on the Cascades run during the struggle for supremacy between the two companies_ _probably hastened the settlement of the controversy._ _The Str. Iris was constructed at the Cascades by master builder Biles. She was_ _a very fast steamer for that period.......She was a short-lived steamer and early_ _in the 70&#39;s was dismantled and her engines, which were 16 x 72 inches, were taken_ _to The Dalles and remodeled, afterward being sent to the lower river where they_ _were placed in a steamer intended for the Astoria run._ _Above The Dalles, the business of the Peoples Transportation Co. was handled by_ _the steamer Kiyus, a small sternwheeler run by Capt. Leonard White. Thus_ _equipped, the new system was in position to demand the generous concession re-_ ceived from the Oregon Steam Navigation Co., when the settlement was arranged, _J. D. Biles was mentioned on P. 196 as Secretary and Treasurer of the Peoples_ _Transportation Co. after it was purchased by Ben Holladay, who appointed himself_ _President, and his son, Ben Holladay, Jr., Vice-President. The company then had_ _10 steamers on the Willamette.&quot;_ _The Str. E. D. Baker was named for Col. E. D. Baker, who was known as &quot;The Old_ _Gray Eagle&quot; (OHQ V9, P. 11). No doubt Lewis Love was one of his admirers. A_ _hotel owned by Lewis Love in Portland (Front &amp; Clay Streets) was also known as_ _&quot;The Gray Eagle&quot; Hotel, no doubt for this same man._ _Excerpt from letter from National Archives, Washington, D. C, dated Aug. 31,_ _1950 to Clara Stone: &quot;No record of vessels named E. D. Baker and Iris has been_ _found. Lewis Love of Washington Territory, however, owned the sloop scow IDA ANN_ _(Official Number 12456) from March 22, 1871 to January 27, 1873, but no final end_ _of the vessel has been found. She had one deck, one mast, a square stern, flat_ _bottom, a square head and measured: 81&#39; x 16&#39; x 4&#39; with a tonnage of 34.65 tons._ _She was built at &quot;Loves Millis&quot; in Clark County, W. T., in 1866.&quot;_ _Apparently there are no records linking the name of Capt. Lewis Love as having_ _participated in the building of the &quot;E. D. Baker&quot;, &quot;Iris&quot;, etc, However the 1850_ _anc 1860 Federal Census for Clark County is rather strong evidence of his parti-_ _cipation in this &quot;boating&quot; venture; and it is not unlikely that he may have had_ _the leading role in it as stated in the manuscript: &quot;It was almost all thrown on_ _my shoulders&quot;._ _ _ _Clark County Census Clark County Census_ _Compiled by Jos.

Since there is no_ _&quot;Flour Miller&quot; listed on the 1850 census, it might be presumed that Mr. Karrall_ _operated the flour mill which Lewis Love built adjacent to his sawmill. No_ _Lumber Miller is listed on the 1850 census, as such._ _(18-A)The above, together with the fact that Lewis Love was the owner of the Vancouver Steam Sawmill property which &quot;ran to low water mark&quot; on the Columbia River, in_ _Vancouver, would indicate this property as the likely location of where the boat_ _E. D. BAKER was built. It is likely also, since the Archives in Washington, D.

The alarm was immediately given_ _and the fire department turned out promptly and soon succeeded in the extinguish-_ _ment of the fire. The damage was not very great. The fire.was undoubtedly the_ _work of an incendiary, the mill not having been occupied or used for some time_ _past. In this connection we may state that we have been requested by Mr. Love,_ _the proprietor, to return his sincere thanks to the fire department and to the_ _citisens generally for their efforts to preserve his property from destruction._ _This project, as in the case of the &quot;boating venture&quot; is not associated in North-_ _west history with the name of Lewis Love, although credit is given to Peoples_ _Transportation Company. Lewis &amp; Dryden states: &quot;Peoples constructed the canal_ _and basin at Oregon City (on the East side just above the present Publishers_ _Paper Company (ex+Hawley mill)) and enjoyed a long period of success until the_ _completion of the locks at West. Linn by another company. Peoples had invested a large amount of money in building the basin above the falls to facilitate_ _in the trans-shipment of freight, which would have been rendered useless if_ _they patronised the new waterway, and they refused to change. Finally, they_ _sold out to Ben Holladay for $200,000. Holladay later failed and sold to the_ _Oregon Steam Navigation Co. Peoples had spent $1,000,000 on boats, docks and_ _improvements during its time.&quot;_ _Have found no records linking the name of Capt. Lewis Love with this project_ _at Oregon City, however, in view of the authenticity of so many of the state-_ _ments made in the manuscript, it might well be presumed there is more truth_ _than fiction connected with his participation in the breakwater, basin and_ _freight shoot at Oregon City, particularly when we bear in mind that many_ _records have been lost in courthouse fires - and otherwise destroyed;_ _(to mention a few: Oregon City, Vancouver, Kalama, Yakima, Bend, Dallas,_ _Tillamook, and not overlooking our State Capitol Building at Salem. Then,_ _too, the freedom with which the public has been allowed access to our court-_ _house records, to the axtent that it has been quite possible for changes to_ _be made in thems and no trick whatever to walk away with complete files. I_ _have been told by two people interested in collecting historical data that_ _they have been approached by someone with official courthouse records &quot;for_ _sale&quot;, Neither of these gentlemen, however, cared to have such material in_ _their possession. An experience of my own: In asking if I might have a_ _photostet of a map that interested me and which was contained in a lawsuit_ _in which I was interested, was told by the young lady in attendance, “Why, I_ _think they might be glad to let you have this map; you know, we have to get_ _rid of a lot of this old material anyhow.&quot; Fortunately, however, when she_ _asked someone with more authority than herself if I might have the map the_ _file contained, it was decided that they would have @ photostat made for me.)_ _Articles about construction of basin and dam at Oregon City in Oregonian under_ _dates of Sept. 19, 1865 and Nov. 21, 1865: Excerpt: “We were shown over the_ _work by Capt.

Lewis Love at this time was owner of the_ _CALLIOPE. Excerpt from letter from the National Archives dated Aug. 31, 1950:_ _&quot;The Steamboat CALLIOPE (Official Number 58,0) was built at Corvallis, Oregon_ _in 1870. She had two decks, one mast, a square stern and a sharp head and_ _measured 100! x 18.5&#39; x h* with a tonnage of 113.36 tons. She was abandoned_ _at Portland, Oregon on Oct. 10, 1889.

Smith - &quot;A trip by Steamboat up the Santiam&quot; -_ _detailed account of CALLIOPE going to Lebanon - also &quot;Being a sternwheeler 100!_ _long, 20&#39; beam, and of light draft, she was able to do an extensive business on_ _the upper river; bearing the proud distinction of being the first steamboat to_ _bring a cargo through the locks at Oregon City, after their completion in_ _January 1873. This cargo consisted of 7 tons of flour, from McMinnville, on_ the Yamhill River, to Portland.” _An acquaintance, @ real student of pioneer history, who has been trying_ _for the past five years to ferret out the history behind his father, and to_ _whom I made mention of the attached manuscript, stating that I had not been_ _able to prove all the statements made in it; made this statement to me: &quot;If_ _you have proved 25 or 50% of it, you can very well believe every word of it_ _is true, and you should not hesitate to bring his manuscript to the attention_ _of the historians. This gentleman passed away a few months ago, with the story_ _behind his father&#39;s activities yet unsolved. In view of the above there is_ _little doubt in my mind of the participation of Captain Love in the work he_ _tells of at Oregon City._ _Activities on the Upper Willamette are borne out by the following issuance of_ _Master licenses, contained in a letter from the National.

Where the road to Vancouver meets the path that is now Columbia Boulevard we see Captain Love’s house, in the northeast corner of the intersection. At that time it was the only house in what is now the Piedmont neighborhood. There seemed to have been basically two roads or paths from Portland to Vancouver. The main one is the County Road and there is a secondary path, which is probably older. Love built his house next to the county road, and John Rankin built his house half a mile to the west, closer to the old path. On the cutout below we see the two houses (as black dots) in rectangle gray areas that indicate improved farm lands. alt_text There is an interesting article in the Morning Oregonian of April 26, 1897. It is an interview with Lewis Love about the period, in 1852-1853. _Captain Love built and occupied the first house on the main road between Portland and Vancouver. It was he who ran that road through to the Columbia Slough, and he was supervisor of the road for a long time._ And: _I moved away in 1855 and rented my home there to John Rankin, who had built a house two years after our arrival, about half a mile west and off the road._ There is another interview in the Morning Oregonian of December 4, 1900, under the inviting title “Mr. Love’s Stories”. _When Mr. Love started to farm on Columbia Slough Indian dances were frequent. Portland was undreamt of._ I somehow doubt the indian dances part. The interview goes on about how Lewis Love got into logging. _It was costing me a great deal to burn up my timber while clearing. I decided to try rafting to Portland. I put about 20,000 logs in the stream during high water in the Winter of 1852. I then built upright posts and yards on one end of the raft and sailed to Portland. A good strong breeze carried us up the river. We made the trip in about four hours. Another time I came near being caught in a pinch on a contract to deliver logs to the mills in Portland. The water dropped down and a strong current was running in the river. We had to work our way up from the head of the Sauvies Island Slough by an improvised capstan, or windlass, the end of the rope being attached to any convenient object along the shore while the windlass was worked taking up the coil of rope. If I remember rightly we were 16 days getting to the city._ Multnomah County did not exist until December 22, 1854. Before that we were in Clackamas County. In 1851 Lewis Love obtained a licence from Clackamas County to operate a ferry across Columbia Slough, on the road towards the ferry across the Columbia River operated by John Switzler (Query, 2008, p. 54). Here is some more detail, including rates. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image6.png).

Although his businesses quite often either flooded or burnt down he made a lot of money, and was generally considered to be a millionaire around 1900.

(Back to top)(Next alert)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alt_text Lewis Love, about 80 years old Lewis Love had a large and complicated family. His children were in the habit of marrying multiple times, and having many children in each marriage. Thus there are also a lot of partners and stepchildren around. There were also some adopted children. In order to keep track I used the MacFamilyTree software. The link below points to a website where you can click your way through (my current version of) the Love family tree. https://www.macfamilytree.com/deleeuw/Love%20Family%20Tree/languages/en/index.html It uses information from many genealogical sources, mostly found on ancestry.com, but also from census information and newspaper articles. The genealogical sources sometimes contradict each other, are often quite incomplete, and contain various errors, but hopefully the errors average out. One error, for example, is that the tree says William Ulysses Love, the oldest son, was born in October 1838 and Jeremiah Joye, the second son, in December 1838. This seems unlikely. Like the rest of this book, the tree is a work in progress. As new information becomes available, it is added. I did limit myself, for obvious reasons, to including children and grandchildren, with their partners. No great-grandchildren, with the exception of Hazel Viola King, because she appears in the will of Lewis Love. Partners of the Love sons and daughters often had previous marriages, and children from those previous marriages. And these children were usually adopted into their new Love families. But they are not included here, because I did not want to follow the various “partners of partners” branches of the tree. Although the web page linked above is the easiest way to follow the descendants, I also include a chart with a global view of the tree. It is unreadable as such, but the URL below it links to a pdf that you can download and enlarge as much as you want. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image10.png).

(Back to top)(Next alert)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alt_text One way to follow the family through time is to look at successive federal census records. This shows where the family lived, which children lived at home, and what the current occupations were. We start in 1840, while the Love family resided in DeKalb, Illinois. The census form is somewhat unclear, and ancestry.com has it under the name Towers Jone, but after deciphering it we see two free white male persons younger than five (sons William and Jeremiah), one free white male person between 20 and 30 (Lewis) and one free white female person between 20 and 30 (Nancy). Of these one person is in the category “working in agriculture” and one in “insane and idiots in public charge”. This harsh label may refer to Jeremiah, who died when four years old in 1842. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DYFULRI5VD80ScBwSTVklXaU8C471cov https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BTysPrzV_QSyBgJ5lO6HA7GZknH4OV7N We know that between 1840 and 1850 the family moved west to Oregon. In 1850 the family arrived on the Columbia Slough and Lewis Love built a home on the northeast corner at the intersection of the Vancouver road and the Slough road (now Columbia Boulevard). They moved from that location in 1855. In the 1860 census the family is in Clark County in Washington Territory. Lewis Love, 42 years old, is a lumber miller. He was already well to do. His real estate holdings were worth about $ 25,000, his personal property was about $ 15,000. His three sons Fred (13), Green (11) and Lewis (9) were living at home. William (married in 1854), Malinda (married in 1856) and Mary (married in 1856) had already moved out. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LUdsRd1OIaaGQv_WTJAepLopJy5i5b4v https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L_J1XGgqmLVaoEaZR287QQDitVB6s1KB In 1870 Lewis was a sawyer in a saw mill, still living in Clark County. He now owned $ 46,000 in real estate and $ 12,000 in personal property. Green (21, now a laborer), Lewis (18), and Mary (11) were living at home. I am not sure which Mary this was, it definitely is not his daughter. It could be Mary Ann Ennis, later Mary A. Love, married to Fred in 1876 when she was 19. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B94Urj3OjM7BaFFwZXQ1R1FzQk0 In the 1880 census Lewis was a steamboat captain, living on 326 First Street in Portland. Green C., a 30 year old steam boat engineer, was the only child still living at home, with his wife Louise C. (age 26), and with three granddaughters Katie L. (age 5), Martha G. (age 2), and Bella R. and with two grandsons Joseph (age 7 months) and Fred D. (age 9). Katie, Martha, and Joseph have a mother born in Oregon, presumably Louise, and Bella and Fred have a mother born in Michigan, which indicates their father is Fred and their mother is Ada Loomis. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t4iwGtu1EzPf6M_Odq61V9DM4-tvAWoK A more precise picture arises from the Portland City Directories. I list the various Love’s that are mentioned in each year for which we have information. Because there is a rapidly increasing number of Love family members over the years, I limit myself to Lewis and Nancy and the children and their partners. I also give the addresses and the professions, when available in the directory.

It was intended for him and his family, but at some point regulations required it to become a general cemetery, to the lasting displeasure of Captain Love. He thus proceeded to reserve another strip of land bordering the Columbia Cemetery, in the northwest corner, just big enough for the graves of him and Nancy. And that was where he was buried on July 7, 1903. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image18.png).

It has a useful list of the real property owned and it lists all the heirs. It shows how careful Lewis Love was to make sure this document was known to be his real and only will. As the end of the Manuscript indicates, he had to deal with forged wills and with challenges of his wife’s will after she died. The will also indicates that in all the years he never sold any real estate, he only bought more. The parcels in sections 10, 11, 14, and 16 were 640 acres at the time of the donation land claim, and they were 757 acres at the time of the testament, mostly by extending the original DLC to the west and to the north over the Slough, by buying parts of the Switzler DLC up to Force’s Lake. Remember that Lewis Love died in 1903. It must have been very frustrating for the heirs that they had to wait for distribution until 1907. The will, and the codicil that follows the will, have been taken from the Love v. Walker et al. lawsuit in the Oregon Supreme Court (Pacific Reporter, 1911). _Know all men by these presents: That I, Lewis Love, of Portland, Multnomah County, Oregon, being over the age of 80 years, and being of sound and disposing mind and memory, do make and declare this as my last will and testament, in manner and form following, that is to say: I make, constitute and appoint T. T. Struble, Philo Holbrook and H. C. Breeden executors of this my last will and testament, and request and direct that no bonds or undertaking be required of them as such, nor of them as trustees to hold my estate to a certain time hereinafter mentioned. I direct that all of my just debts, including funeral expenses and the expenses of administration, be paid by my executors. I order that my purpose and ownership of property shall be clearly understood, I hereby preface my devises and requests as follows: I have made no deed to any person or persons to any real or personal property to take effect at or after my death. I made five deeds to my children and grandchildren September 21, 1894, which were executed and acknowledged before T. T. Struble, notary public. I made eights deeds to my children, grandchildren and grandchild December 28, 1896, which were also acknowledged before T. T. Struble, notary public, other than these mentioned deeds I have made none since the first mentioned ones of September 21, 1894. I am the owner absolute of the following real property in the city of Portland, Oregon: Lots 1 and 2, block 177, city; lot 4, block 116, city; lot 3, block 10, city; north half lot 2, block 10, city; lot 8, block 11, city; south half of lot 2, block 4, city; the est 75 feet and 11 inches of the south half of lot 4, block 3, city; the north half of lot 4, block 3, city; the south half of lot 3, block 3, city. I have never made a deed to any person or persons of any part or piece of this property whatever. I also own 757 acres, more or less, of land in sections 10, 11, 14, and 15, township 1 north, range 1 east, Willamette meridian; a portion of this land is outside of and a portion inside the city limits of Portland, Oregon._ _I have made no deed to any of this acreage to any person or persons at any time, except for Columbia Cemetery. It is my purpose to will at this time all of my property, personal, real and mixed, to my legal heirs in the same proportion as the law would convey the same to them in the absence of any will by me, reserving only the burial place where my wife is now buried, and a strip of land two feet in width adjacent thereto on the west, north and east of said burial spot, and I hereby set aside said burial place (spot) and said two feet of land adjacent thereto forever as a resting place or burial spot for my wife and myself; said burial place joins Columbia Cemetery on the northwest corner, which said cemetery is in section 10, township 1 north, range 1 east, Willamette meridian._ _My will is and I direct that my estate shall be divided into six (6) shares or parts of equal value, to be disposed of in the following manner, viz: First. I give, devise and bequeath to my son, Fred D. Love, one of said shares or parts. Second. I give, devise and bequeath to my son, Green C. Love, one of said shares or parts. Third. I give, devise and bequeath to my son, Lewis P. Love, one of said shares or parts. Fourth. I give, devise and bequeath to my grandson, William King, a son of my deceased daughter Malinda J. Sheperd, one-third part of one of said shares or parts. Fifth. I give, devise and bequeath to my granddaughter, Matilda Sheperd, wife of James Shepard, and a daughter of my deceased daughter Malinda J. Sheperd, one-third part of one of said shares or parts. Sixth. I give, devise and bequeath to my great-granddaughter, Hazel King, who is a minor child, and a daughter of Albion King, deceased, who is a son of my deceased daughter Malinda J. Sheperd, one-third part of one of said shares or parts. Seventh. I give, devise and bequeath to my daughter, Mary C. Stafford, one of said shares or parts. Eighth. I give, devise and bequeath to the children of my deceased son, William Love, one of said shares or parts of my estate to be divided among said children as follows: To L.W. Love, the one-fifth part of said share; to John A. Love, the one-fifth part of said share; to Ulysses G. Love, the one-fifth part of said share; to Charles W. Love, the one-fifth part of said share; to Frank P. Love, the one-fifth part of said share._ _It is my will and purpose that my estate shall be kept intact and not distributed to my devisees till January 1, 1907 (nineteen hundred and seven). I direct that my executors shall proceed to administer upon my estate at once after my demise, and having in due time closed up my estate as executors, that then my estate shall pass to them as trustees, to be held in trust for my said devisees till January 1, 1907, and managed by them as such trustees until the time of final distribution. I direct that my trustees, T. T. Struble, Philo Holbrook and H. C. Breeden, from time to time as the receipts of my estate may exceed the expenditures, such portion thereof as in the judgment of my said trustees can safely be distributed and paid to the devisees pro rata, not oftener than two times in each twelve months. I direct that my trustees make final distribution of my estate on January 1, 1907, or as soon thereafter as practicable, and if my devisees can agree, said final distribution can be by division of my property by such agreement, but if they cannot so agree, the my trustees shall make a division of my property according to the shares and parts of shares in my estate and my devisees can cast lots for their several interests either in person or by their lawful representatives. Be it remembered, however, that in the administration of my estate by my executors, and before they close up my estate, and it passes to them as trustees, all personal property is to be sold, and the proceeds of such sale will belong to and become a part of my estate._ _In their trust my trustees are hereby empowered to rent property and collect rents, make necessary repairs to property, pay taxes, or to be more explicit, they are empowered hereby to collectively do all acts that I could do were I living, necessary tp protect and keep my estate intact for my devisees hereinbefore mentioned. Should a vacancy occur in my trustees, then the remaining ones or one are to act and carry out this trust. This is my only will, but I now refer to a canceled will made by me April 13, 1896, for the purpose of corroborating the idea that it was always my purpose to distribute my property equally between my several children and to the heirs of those of my children who had died, leaving children or grandchildren._ _Be it remembered that reference to said canceled will shall not make it a part of this will, but only show what my intentions have always been toward my heirs. Reference to the fact in this will that I am the owner of and have made no deed to certain property, is because I have been informed, reliably, of one fraudulent deed to certain valuable property purporting to have been made by me and also have heard rumours of the existence of another fraudulent deed. I pronounce and declare alls such deeds or deed as fraudulent; and any and all claims of any person or persons of having genuine deeds or titles to any of the property hereinbefore described, are false and villainous, and I hereby instruct my executors and trustees to context any such claims to the uttermost, that my property may be kept intact and saved to my lawful heirs as herein devised. And lastly, I do hereby revoke all other wills heretofore made by me, and declare this and no other to be my last will and testament, and desire that of this proof shall be taken and admitted to probate as a muniment of title._ _In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 5th day of January, 1899. _ _[Signed] Lewis Love [Seal]_ So a short summary of the distribution of the estate is: ⅙ to Fred D. Love ⅙ to Green C. Love ⅙ to Lewis P. Love ⅙ to Mary C. Stafford ⅙ to children of Malinda J. Sheperd (†) William King Matilde Sheperd Albion King (†) - Hazel King ⅙ to children of William Love (†) Lewis W. Love John A. Love Ulysses G. Love Charles W. Love Frank P. Love Thus, for example, Ulysses Love gets 1/30 of the estate, and Hazel King gets 1/18. On February 26, 1902, Lewis Love added a codicil to his will, and one that caused a great deal of consternation and a long-lasting lawsuit after his death. _I, Lewis Love of Portland, Oregon, do make this codicil to my will. I hereby expressly confirm my last will, dated January 5, 1899, excepting in so far as the distribution of my property is changed by this codicil. First. I hereby will, decree and declare that the devise or legacy to my daughter, Mary C. Stafford in my said will, shall be for her sole and separate use, independent of her husband at all times, and that at her death the said devise or legacy to her shall go to her children, share and share alike. Second. I hereby will, decree and declare that the devise or legacy, in my said will, to my son, Fred D. Love, shall be for his sole and separate use, independent of his wife at all times, and that at his death the said devise or legacy to him shall go to his children, share and share alike. Third. Second. I hereby will, decree and declare that the devise or legacy in my said will to my son, Green C. Love shall be for his sole and separate use, independent of his wife at all times, and that in case of his death without lawful issue, born alive and living at the time of his death, then the said devise or legacy to him shall belong and go to the remaining devisees of my said will in proportion as they hold of the shares or parts of my said will. Lastly. I declare this is a codicil to my will, and that this is the only codicil that I have made, and I hereby declare my said will of date January 5, 1899, to be my last will and testament and also hereby re-affirm the same in every particular, except a modified by this codicil, which codicil is to be attached to the sad will. Witness my hand and sea this 26th day of February, 1902. [Signed] Lewis Love. [Seal.]_ The codicil does two things. It protects the estate against the scheming husbands and wives of Mary, Fred, and Green and makes sure the property only travels in a straight genealogical line, without reverting to inlaws and other deplorables. In the second place it singles out Green C. Love, who was married in 1876 and had five children. In 1896, however, both his wife and all his children had died. He remarried in 1901 with a bride he had found through a personal ad, which was a method and a resulting bride the Captain did not approve of. So again the special provision had be added to the codicil to make sure the property did not go to outsiders. As we shall see this codicil resulted in lawsuits and court proceedings that lasted more than ten years. More about this later in this chapter. 2.11.9 Nancy M. Griffith (Love) Frustratingly little is known about Nancy M. Griffith, who married Lewis Love in 18. .She was born November 4, 1820 in .. and she died December 26, 1892. The 1870 census notes she can neither read nor write, but we do not see this in the 1880 census. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image21.png).

Love William Love was the oldest son. As we have seen, he died in 1879. The next two sons were Jeremiah, who lived from 1838 until 1842, and Joseph, who lived from 1845 until 1862. I know very little about Jeremiah and Joseph. The manuscript of Captain Lewis Love says that three of his sons drowned, but it only mentions William by name as one of them. So I assume that both Jeremiah and Joseph drowned. Note that Jeremiah died before the family moved to Oregon. 2.11.10.1 William Love: The Dairy Man The oldest son, William Ulysses Love, was born in 1838 in Missouri. He traveled with his parents to Oregon in 1849. He first married Temperance Shaver on November 2, 1854, who died March 1, 1858 after giving birth to two children, and then on March 10, 1859 he married 14 year old Sarah Catherine Windle, with whom he had an additional seven children. Here is a URL linking to his part of the Love family tree. https://www.macfamilytree.com/deleeuw/Love%20Family%20Tree/languages/en/persons/Person_87445564.html In the 1870’s William Love ran a successful dairy business from his home on the Columbia Slough.

I do not know where he got the more than one thousand dollars to pay for it, but let’s review the parcel we are talking about. On March 10, 1866 the United States registered a military warrant for 160 acres to Charles Vincent, for his service in Private Company H, 2nd Regiment of U.S. Dragoons, in some so-called Apache Indian Disturbance. Charles Vincent immediately transferred the land to Robert S. Maxey. Here is the patent. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OUOOb58IKpdXVW8GebZXacBx45Y_f0dw The precise description of the land is _The fractional South East quarter of Section Nine and the Fractional South West quarter of Section Ten in Township One North of Range One East in the District of lands subject to sale at Oregon City, Oregon, containing one hundred and Fifty two acres and one hundredth of an acre._ In terms of modern streets, the land is bounded by Kilpatrick to the north, Lombard to the south, the I-5 to the east, and (approximately) Delaware to the west. In other words, a large chunk of current Kenton. On December 28, 1860 Robert S. Maxey sold the 152.01 acres to William Love for one thousand and twenty five dollars. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1d0DwA318z6u_lHuJCiMru_CyE84ScvE- The dates on the deed are interesting. The Military Donation act was passed in 1855, and presumably Charles Vincent claimed his donation shortly after that. Then Robert Maxey sold to William Love in 1860, even though the official warrant was not issued until 1866. If we go over the various homesteads and donation land grants mentioned in this book we see that many of the warrants and patents were not registered until 1866. This delay is not unusual, as Vaughan (2014, p. 45) explains. _The GLO district land offices were required to certify entitlement to a land patent by issuance of a final certificate upon satisfaction of all statutory requirements by the entryman or purchaser._ And the year 1866 is of special significance. Again from Vaughan (2014, p. 45) _The issuance of land patents was greatly curtailed during the turbulent Civil War years of 1861 to 1865 – delaying most donation land claim patents until after the war._ In the case of the Maxey-Love transaction there was even more delay. The deed was signed in 1860 in the County of Clark, Territory of Washington, in the presence of William Kelly, Clerk of the District Court. Mr. Kelly basically notarized the signing of the deed, using an oath by a Mr. John Hexler that the person who appeared before him was indeed Robert Maxey. This may not have been enough to actually file the deed with Multnomah County, and in 1877 Roger Greene, associate justice of the Washington Supreme Court, testified that William Kelly was indeed a clerk at that time, and that the laws of Washington authorized him to notarize the deed. In addition, in 1882, a Mr. McConnell, the current clerk and record keeper for the district court, testified that William Kelly was who he said he was, and that his signature was indeed his true signature. So this was 22 years after the original signing. Moreover, as we shall see, it was three years after the death of William Love. Over the years, William Love became a thriving and well-respected citizen. In the 1870 census the family lived in the Willamette Precinct with six children and two laborers. In 1875 William was appointed Supervisor of Multnomah County road district 3. In 1876 he was appointed Judge of Elections in the Willamette District. He also served on the school board for the district. But all was not well. Below are two articles from the Morning Oregonian, the first from February 12, 1879 and the second from the next day, and one from the Willamette Farmer of February 14. William Love committed suicide by drowning himself in the Columbia Slough. “… he had rid himself of his bodily ills by casting himself into the river.”_ _There is obviously no clear diagnosis of his ailment in these articles from 1879, but the officiating clergyman mentioned that “a protracted illness of nearly two years, accompanied by occasional paroxysms of internal distress, had so far unbalanced his mind as to constitute him periodically insane.” &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image24.png).

For those who are really interested, here is a link to the 143-page probate file from the Multnomah County Court. https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B94Urj3OjM7BeloyaENaVTVwcVU As is usually the case with probate files, it is a genuine treasure trove of information. It has appraisals and descriptions of personal and real property, receipts for various transactions, debts of the estate, letters, court orders, and much more.

Ulery et al valued the land at $ 2,500. Lewis Love asked permission of the court to sell the land by auction in three pieces: the western half, the western half of the eastern half, and the eastern half of the eastern half. And this is exactly what happened. On February 11, 1882 the western half was sold to William Showers, sheriff of Multnomah County, for $ 1,634.10. At the same auction the western half of the eastern half was sold to Charles Sitton for $ 798.04. It seems that something was wrong with the Showers transaction. On May 15, 1882 there was a second auction, where Joseph Buchtel, sheriff of Multnomah County, bought the western half for $ 3,192.20. The eastern half of the eastern half, which was the part where William Love had his house and business, and the part adjoining the Lewis Love DLC, was not sold, at least not yet. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image28.png).

We see the land sales, totalling $ 3,192.20 + $ 798.04 = $ 3,990.24. There are other items on the “money received” side that are interesting. There were 670 cords of wood, appraised at $ 700. There were 500 bushels of potatoes, appraised at 60 cents a bushel. They had to be sold rather quickly, otherwise they would sprout. There were six adult cows, appraised at $ 25 per cow, 3 two-year old cows at $ 15, and 3 one-year old cows at $ 7.50. On the “money paid” side we see more than $ 250 paid to neighbor John Hotts, who plays a role in many of the chapters of this book. The $ 408 paid to Antoine Masley was the balance for “work and labor” performed at the request of William Love during the years 1875-1879, at a salary of $ 30 per month. We also see $ 643.98 paid to the Oregon and Washington Trust and Investment Company. This is for a mortgage of originally $ 600 on his land that William Love got in 1877. The biannual payments were about $ 77, and these payments were three years in arrears in 1882. The balance of the account was distributed to Sarah Love and her six sons (or to their guardians, if they were still minors in 1882). Each of them got $ 371.53. There were only six sons left, because William Albert Love died in 1880, at the age of twenty. The administrator Lewis Love received $ 216.90. Sarah Love continued to live on the homestead until 1897. Then she died. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image30.png).

Sheperd Malinda June Love (sometimes Melinda June) was the oldest daughter. She was born in Missouri in 1841. I know very little about her, presumably because her career was “keeping house”. She married three times, the first time in 1856, when she was 15. Her first husband was John P. King, a farmer and general utility man located in Benton County, in the Corvallis area. He was born in 1835 in Iowa and came to Oregon in 1853. His OHS archive card tells us he was a socialist. Good for him. In the 1860 census the couple lived in Corvallis, and they had a one year old son Theodore. In 1870 Malinda lived with Theodore and eight year old Albion and three year old William in Clark County, Territory of Washington. Both Albion and William were born in Washington, but there is no John P. King on the census form any more. In 1880 we do find John P. King, a carpenter, and Theodore King, now a 21 year old mail carrier, in the lovely-named city of Philomath, close to Corvallis.

Love was born in Missouri on April 25, 1842. She crossed the plains with her parents and arrived in Multnomah in 1849. On September 14, 1856, when she was 14 years old, she married George W. Shafer (or Schaeffer), who was 30 years old at the time, and in the grocery store business with her father. George Shaeffer died the next year, and Mary married Nathan D. Stafford in 1859, when he was 33 years old and she was 17, and already two years a widow. O tempora ! O mores ! From then on, we can follow Mary through the successive federal censuses and city directories and see what the composition of her household is. Around 1880 she is listed as a nurse or midwife, while Nathan is a carpenter. In 1860 Mary has given birth to a daughter Emeline, at the census date 7 months old. In 1870 Emeline is 8, and she are joined by Leona (6), Matilda (4), and Ulysses Grant (1). In 1880 we find Ida (13), Louis G. (11), Nancy M. (9), Sarah R. (7), Delia (5), Lena (3), and Geo (2 months). There is no 1890 census, and in 1900 there are no new children, and we have Lena (22), Lewis (31), and Nellie C (34) living at home. Nathan Stafford died in 1903. In the 1910 census Mary has moved in with her daughter Alice (then Alice L. Preacher) and in 1920 she lives with her other daughter Nancy (then Nancy M. Finke). She dies August 14, 1927 at 360 E. Lombard Street (now 65 NE Lombard), 85 years old. From the eulogies it seems that the surviving children are Emma J. Walker, Alsistres L. Peacher, Lewis G. Stafford, Nancy M. Finke, Sedelia P. Hohmann, all of Portland, Oregon, Sarah R. Anderson of Orchards, Washington, and Lena G. Richmond of Ardenwald, Oregon. Note that Emma is Emeline, the oldest daughter, born in 1860. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image37.png).

Snyder (1979, p 208) says _The original dedication of this street was in the University Park neighborhood. If, as we believe, the name was chosen by the Methodists who developed University Park, it is probably a namesake for Charles Lewis Stafford, who was president of Iowa Wesleyan University 1891-1899. _ Nice try, but no cigar. There seems to have been a Stafford Street in South Saint John’s, which was renamed out of existence around 1908. There is a small section of Stafford Street on the border of University Park, between Woolsey and Olin, at the south line of Mock’s Addition, but it was originally called Syracuse Street, and it was renamed to Stafford Street in 1918. I do not see a Stafford Street in the original 1891 plat maps for University Park. There is one in the original plats for Loveleigh, Lovewood, and Swinton from around 1908. And then around 1910-1920 there was some additional renaming and Stafford Street came to run east from Union through Farrell’s Addition and Farrell’s Second Addition until it ran into Lombard and stopped. . 2.11.10.4 Frederick D. Love: The Black Sheep After William died the next oldest son, and one that survived to a ripe old age, was Frederick Decatur Love. He was a colorful one.

Morris (6) Initially, Fred and his father seemed to have had a fairly normal relationship. Fred worked in his father’s saw mill, and was captain on his father’s steamboats. There may have been some minor conflicts, caused by incidents such as the one reported in the Vancouver Independent of December 7, 1882. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image39.png).

(Back to top)(Next alert)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alt_text But the relationship went definitely south after the death of Nancy in 1892, and at breakneck speed. The reason is probably that there were two different versions of Nancy’s wills circulating. I will discuss this in great detail in the section on the fake will in this chapter, but for now it suffices to know that in one of the wills Nancy left $ 100 to each of her sons and daughters, and the rest of the estate to Lewis Love while in the other will she left $ 100 to Lewis Love and the rest of the estate to her sons and daughters. And remember that it was the Lewis and Nancy Love Donation Land Claim, which means that legally she was the owner of 320 acres. And development had started in the area, with Good Morning Addition, Piedmont, Woodlawn, Saratoga, Lochinvar all having been platted in 1892. Captain Lewis Love was an old hand at lawsuits, and he did not take kindly to the fact that Fred Love sued him in trying to throw out the first will, favorable to Lewis, and replace it by the second will, favorable to the offspring, and thus to Fred. It seems Lewis did not take half measures, and he had Fred arrested for insanity in November 1892.
