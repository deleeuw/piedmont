Last update August 31, 2021 Introduction Piedmont Piedmont is one of the 95 neighborhoods in the neighborhood system of Portland, Oregon, and one of the eleven neighborhoods in the North Portland district coalition. Portland’s nationally recognized neighborhood system is made up of 95 recognized, independent neighborhood associations and seven neighborhood district coalition offices that represent the entire city of Portland. https://www.portlandoregon.gov/oni/28989 The Piedmont neighborhood gets its name from the Piedmont subdivision, platted in 1889 by Edward Quackenbush and the Investment Company. And the Piedmont subdivision gets its name from the region in northwest Italy, known for its gentle slopes and hillsides. I am pretty sure the name Piedmont was chosen for its commercial appeal, and not for the physical resemblance with the eponymous region in Italy, which actually looks quite different. Although:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont_(United_States) The Piedmont subdivision is only a small part of the Piedmont neighborhood, in fact less than ten percent of its area. And, conversely, only half of the Piedmont subdivision is in the Piedmont neighborhood, the rest is in Humboldt and King. Land Throughout this book, I concentrate on land and land ownership. It is essential, therefore, to remember that Oregon, Portland, and Piedmont were started by settler colonialism. This meant the United States occupied lands used for centuries by indigenous peoples, and declared it to be public lands of the United States. War, terror, vigilantes, disease, broken treaties, racism, religion, and unjust laws made sure the unceded lands stayed in the hands of the occupying forces. The small percentage of indigenous people that survived the onslaught were driven onto ever shrinking reservations. In the middle of the nineteenth century, when settlers started to arrive and Portland became a fast growing city, there were very few Native Americans left in the area. In that nineteenth century the United States adopted laws which encouraged settlement by giving large sections of public lands away (usually tracts of 160 acres), and making other sections available for very little money (usually for $ 1.25 per acre). The land that currently makes up Piedmont was donated in this way to just four people. Evander Howe, George Smith, Lewis Love, and David Ulery were all farmers on the Vancouver Road, near the Columbia Slough. They could effectively use the Donation Land Claim Act and the Military Bounty Law, because they were the first settlers to arrive, and actually for quite some time the only settlers to arrive. In the next stage the city grew because the settlers, or “pioneers”, sold their land to developers, who platted subdivisions. Piedmont over the years became differentiated from about four homesteads to about 30 subdivisions of varying sizes. From 1850 on fortunes were made by subdividing, exchanging, transfering, inheriting, buying, and selling pieces of land. In the third stage of development each of the subdivisions, sometimes also called additions, were partitioned into a varying number of city blocks, usually 200 by 200 feet, and the blocks were partitioned in lots, usually eight lots of 100 by 50 feet. These individual lots were then sold to people to build their houses, or packaged into multiple lots for speculation. Piedmont consists of thousands of such lots. In the book I will discuss the original homesteads and the subsequent subdivisions. As a consequence of this emphasis on land, the book concentrates on the time between 1850 and 1930. After 1930 development is mostly down to the level of individual lots, and since there are about 5000 of these, I cannot discuss them one by one. It is interesting, of course, to find out who built an individual house, and who the subsequent owners were. But the sheer number of them makes it impossible to write about each and every one. Bias As you will probably figure out quickly, I like maps. I also like facts, more than I like opinions. I like words, more than I like photographs. Thus this book is not of the coffee table type, with many photos and only a few words. I also do not like the view that historical developments are driven by a small number of important individuals, always men of course, and that we want to know as much as possible about these men, possibly because we want to become just like them. History is driven by social and economic forces and movements in which specific individuals are of limited and largely anecdotal significance. I like to report about structures and systems more than I like to report about people. Also, I hope that what I do report about the men and women that were important in Piedmont’s early history makes it clear that you do not necessarily want to become just like them. There are two other important types of Portland history books I do not want to emulate. Some of them are excellent, but they are not what I am interested in. There are those books that concentrate on vice, corruption, crime, shanghaiing, and prostitution. They are mostly about the northwest of Portland, between 1870 and 1910. And then there are those books that tell the story of city government and the business community, again mostly although not entirely about the part of Portland west of the river. As far as I am concerned, these two types of books talk about two sides of the same coin, a bunch of people quibbling on how to divide the loot. Of course that describes a huge part of history in general, and in this book the loot is basically two square miles of land, sections 10 and 15 in township one north, range one east of the Willamette Meridian. Technical This book is, and always will be, free and in the public domain. Anyone can copy, print, distribute or otherwise use the material in this book for any purpose whatsoever, and, if they so choose, without attribution. All references are collected in the back of each chapter or section. I have tried to make everything reproducible, in the sense that every statement of fact that I make can be traced back to its sources. I have also tried to emphasize primary (i.e. contemporaneous) sources, even if they were only newspaper articles. Secondary sources are only used, reluctantly, if primary sources are not available. I have also tried to refrain, as much as is humanly possible, from stating opinions about events, or making inferences about motives. This book is a living document, which means that any part of it can change at any moment. Thus all sections have a date attached to their title, indicating when they were last changed. I keep discovering new facts and adding new materials. In the table of contents each section is linked to a separate pdf, which is synchronized with the sections in the Google docs version of the book. This book is also, among other things, a repository. There are copies of, or links to, the original maps, deeds, photos, and newspaper articles that the narrative is based on.

Red Cloud, Lakota, around 1900 It is appropriate to start this book with a chapter on the Native Americans who were here first and who lived on the land that is currently the Piedmont Neighborhood. It turns out that this is far from easy. I will have to rely heavily on a huge amount of research on relatively sparse data, documented most thoroughly in an excellent recent edited volume. Robert T. Boyd, Kenneth M. Ames, Tony A. Johnson (eds): Chinookan Peoples of the Lower Columbia. University of Washington Press, 2013. To set the scene we start with two statues in Washington Park. The first one, on the left, is called “The Coming of the White Man”. The sculptor was Hermon Atkins MacNeil (1866 – 1947), who specialized in Native American scenes. This particular statue was gifted to the City of Portland in 1904 by former mayor David P. Thompson. It depicts two Native American men looking towards the Columbia River upon the arrival of Lewis and Clark. The older man, with arms crossed, is supposedly Chief Multnomah, the younger one is not identified. Sculptor MacNeil continued to make and sell many separate copies of the Chief Multnomah figure. There are some problems with the statue, independent of its artistic merits. First, there is a relatively minor historical problem. For a long time historians have denied that Chief Multnomah was an actual historical figure. Recent research (Fulton, 2005), relying on the native american oral tradition, maintains that he did indeed exist. He was a powerful and important chief, who controlled a large territory around the Willamette river, and commanded many warriors. He died around 1780, possibly in the first smallpox epidemic. Whether he existed or not, he was no longer living when Lewis and Clark arrived in 1804-1805. The second problem, which was unavoidable at the time, is that the statue is firmly in the white supremacist tradition of the Noble Savage, the Theatrical Savage, and the Picturesque Savage (Ellington, 2001). A good way to illustrate this is with a contemporary review of the statue by one Arno Dosch in the Pacific Monthly of 1905. Mr. MacNeil has put thought and genius into that old chief. He has depicted a patriarch in the full possession of his bodily strength, with a frame of iron, legs of steel cords and an arm of certain stroke. He stand on his toes to see better, binding his knees with tendons and drawing the cords over his thighs, hollowing the hips and bringing out the groin line clear. His are the legs of perfect strength, with the veins showing a little more prominently than in a younger man. On an upright body, with arms folded and a shield slung over the back, rises the head. In the face is the power. It is that of a Multnomah, a man of mental ability, a brooding savage, an Indian chief. He guided his own people by his wisdom, and let them in conquest on the enemy. The neck is drawn in heavy cords, and upon it is the chin of hauteur, almost disdain, the eyes expectant, but not astonished; the nose masterful, the strong hair bound back by a band._ The younger person is also described by Dosch. His attitude is in direct contrast to that of his elder. His whole body and face expresses open curiosity and wonderment. He holds aloft on his right hand a branch, just broken from a tree, and waves it as a token of good will to the strangers. At some point in time in the 1930’s someone, presumably someone with a more keen sense of history, broke off this olive branch from the statue. It has not been restored. Remember that Arno Dosch wrote in 1905. In the preceding 100 years an estimated ninety percent of the Native American population had disappeared. They largely succumbed to diseases brought by the white man. But they had also been hunted down and killed by vigilantes and slaughtered in staged so-called “Indian Wars” by the army. They were driven from their lands, tricked into signing treaties that would never be ratified, and they were forcibly removed to areas east of the Cascades, or driven onto small reservations of land that the white settlers did not want. In 1905 the expression on the face of Chief Multnomah should have alternated between immense sadness and equally immense rage. The second statue in Washington Park, the picture on the right, is “Sacajawea and Jean-Baptiste”. The sculpture was commissioned for the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition (1905) by the Committee of Portland Women, who requested a sculpture of “the only woman in the Lewis and Clark Expedition and in honor of the pioneer mother of old Oregon.” 1.1 Before Contact Archeology 1.2 Discovering the Columbia 1.3 The Lewis and Clark Journals The two visits to Native American sites in the Columbia Basin/Wapato Valley 1.4 The Wapato Valley Native Americans 1.5 The Spirit of Pestilence 1.6 The Extinction of Indian Title How the lands were taken away (In the Courts of the Conqueror, Conquest by Law). There has been some discussion as to the origin of our title to what was known as the Oregon country, comprising the State of Oregon, Washington and Idaho, and the portions of Montana and Wyoming west of the Rocky Mountains. The question wa whether our title was derived from the Louisiana Purchase or directly by discovery and prior possession. As the result of discussion by the General Land Office in 1898, the map of the United States now issued by that office states that the title was established in 1846. The exact basis of our claim has apparently never been authoritatively decided (Bien, 1910, page 388). 1.7 Present Day Multnomah County 1.8 References Morris Bien: The Public Lands of the United States.

There is only a small number of them, five or so, and the large parcels (in the blue lines) in most cases also overlap with the adjacent neighborhoods Woodlawn, Overlook, Humboldt, King, Arbor Lodge, Kenton, and East Columbia. I shall use the generic name “homesteads” for these properties, although not all of them were authorized by the homestead act, and not all the original grantees actually homesteaded on them. To put this in a larger context, here is the map of the 1860 survey of all of Township 1 of Range 1 east, which covers all of Portland, including East Portland and Albina. alt_text https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TISCAUaStTYOVqZS58E5ao4AFFOkmzSl Remember that links in the captions below pictures and photos generally point to a larger and/or higher resolution version elsewhere on the web. On the map it says, in the lower right hand corner, The above Map of the Survey of Claims in the Township No1 North Range No1 East of the Willamette Meridian, Oregon, is strictly conformable to the field notes of the surveys thereof in file at this office, which have been examined and approved. Surveyor General’s Office, Eugene City, September 20th 1860 The township and range terminology will be discussed later in this introductory chapter, in the section on the Public Land Survey System. 2.1.2 Our Discussion Each of our homestead chapters is divided into two parts. In the first part I discuss the land, how it was obtained, partitioned, and sold. In the second part I discuss the biographical information I have on the settlers who claimed the land and obtained the patents from the US government. The order of the two parts reflects the emphasis in this book on the ownership of the land, the persons are in some sense accidental, no matter how interesting their lives may have been. But sometimes the division between the land dealings and the life are somewhat artificial, because basically what we know about some of the homesteaders is precisely that they homesteaded in what is now the Piedmont neighborhood. And not much more. How the land changed hands covers a period from the original claim to the point, often some fifty years later, when the final subdivisions were platted and the plats recorded with Multnomah County. Some plats have hundreds of lots, and it is not feasible to find out and document how individual lots were sold by the original sellers, and then later by the various owners along the way. So I stop at the subdivision level, although there are some exceptions because there is land that was not platted, and there are some lots and buildings on the land with historical significance. Snyder’s 1989 book “We Claimed This Land: Portland Pioneer Settlers” is impressive, because it covers 212 “pioneers”, defined as persons or families who “were the first to settle on the land that is now occupied by the city of Portland, Oregon.” (1989, preface, page v). But 212 biographies in a book of 278 pages implies that some of them will be very short. Especially because some of the pioneers do get a lot of pages. A. P. Dennison, for example, inexplicably gets 22 pages, which is definitely not proportional to his historical importance. Moreover, Snyder concentrates on pioneers associated with the original site of the City of Portland, on the west side of the Willamette, and on the more urban tracts. This makes perfect sense, because information about them is more readily available. Our Piedmont pioneers Evander Howe (10 lines), George Smith (9 lines), and David Ulery (12 lines) are given short shrift, simply because Snyder does not have more information on them. And some of the information is incorrect or imprecise. Captain Lewis Love gets three pages, which is still not much for such a long and eventful life. John Fenstermacher gets a full page, but mostly because of the tabloid aspects of his life and death. Because we only have to consider just four or five pioneers we can dig much deeper, and find more (and more correct) information. We freely use the words “pioneers” and “settlers”, although both words have plenty of negative connotations these days (Sakai, 2014). The words seem to suggest that the white people who came from the east arrived on virgin land (the terra nullius doctrine), which was waiting to be occupied, utilized, monetarized, and exploited. The alternative interpretation of what took place in the early nineteenth century is, of course, that all that land was invaded and occupied, and the original inhabitants, the ones that did not succumb to the infectious diseases brought by the settlers, were forcibly removed and in many instances killed. As a rule the white settlers seem to have been brave, daring, inventive, hard working, and incredibly resistant to many kinds of adversity. They came to improve their situation, and many who came early succeeded in doing just that. Their improvement was made possible, however, by the racism, exceptionalism, and manifest destiny ideologies promoted by the ruling classes. And we should not forget they were, wittingly or unwittingly, part of a racist and colonialist invasion that resulted in an horrific genocide (Dunbar-Ortiz, 2014) 2.1.3 Land Laws There were multiple laws passed by Congress in the eighteenth and nineteenth century on which the various donations and patents are based. Some of them were actually donations, which means the settlers did not have to pay anything for the land, and some were for-pay, although always for very little money. Because nothing beats looking at the original documents, in the exact language they were written in, I provide links to the actual laws. In the references at the end of the chapter there are links to Wikipedia articles that provide at least some background. If you want to know more about how the United States disposed on its public lands through a whole sequence of homestead type acts, there is the authoritative article by Bien (1910). For an even more extensive discussion of the donations of various types in Oregon (including giveaways to railroads, timber harvesting, or military wagon roads) see the dissertation by Jerry O’Callaghan (1951).

May 20, 1862: An Act to secure Homesteads to actual Settlers in the Public Domain. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S1TuL2j2sMidQAdCahzAFG4hSx27SkhV On the map at the beginning of this chapter Lewis Love and John Rankin used the Oregon Donation Land Act of 1850. John Fenstermacher and Evander Howe used the Homestead Act of 1862 (which means they had to pay for their land). George Smith, Robert Maxey, and David Ulery used the Military Bounty Act of 1855. In all three cases, however, they were not the ones doing the actual military service. By informal and and by now unknowable transactions they made the original military men sign over their patents, undoubtedly for a pittance. The Oregon Donation Land Act of 1850 deserves some additional attention, because it is specific to our region. The Genealogical Forum of Oregon (2014) has a nice brochure, with the essential facts. Also quite readable is the page on the act of theOregon History Project (2018). 2.1.4 Public Land Survey System The _Rectangular Survey System** **_was created by the Land Ordinance of 1785. It covers the United States with squares of 6 by 6 miles. It then introduces a local coordinate system by designating a vertical lines (meridian) and horizontal line (base line). In our case the vertical line is the Willamette Meridian, running through the hills west of Portland, and the horizontal line is the Willamette base line, along Base Line Street (now Stark Street). The two intersect at the Willamette Stone. This local coordinate system allows one to code the squares, indicating how many squares east or west of the meridian, and how many squares north or south of the base line they are. The figure below, taken from page 25 of the excellent e-book by Vaughan (2014), show both meridian and base line. alt_text On the map at the beginning of this chapter you see modern Piedmont in the red boundaries. The black squares are sections 9, 10, 15, and 16 of Township 1 North, Range 1 East (T 1N R 1E), i.e. the first square north of the baseline and east of the meridian. A township in PLSS is six by six miles, with 36 sections. Thus T 1N R 1E covers most of Portland. A black section is a square mile, or 640 acres, and the four quarters of a section (NE, SE, SW, NW) are each 160 acres. The following figure, from page 28, of Vaughan (2014), illustrates the basics. alt_text The rectangular system is used throughout to locate parcels of land, where basically each of the townships provides another even more local coordinate system. We can now say, for example, that a piece of land in the figure above is the SE ¼ of the NW quadrant of Section 14 in township 4 south of range 3 west. Even more importantly, parcels of land, especially in the homestead period, are often defined as sections or quarters of the system, and as a consequence roads often align with boundaries of quarters as well. 2.1.5 Surveyors Lengths In many of the deeds from the nineteenth century parcels of land are described in the language of surveyors, and the boundaries are described in the units of length used by surveyors around that time. Since these units may be unfamiliar to modern readers, I briefly summarize definitions of the most common ones, and show how to translate them into feet and even meters. _The name **furlong** derives from the [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English_language) words furh (furrow) and lang (long). Dating back at least to early [Anglo-Saxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon) times, it originally referred to the length of the furrow in one [acre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre) of a ploughed [open field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-field_system) (a medieval communal field which was divided into strips). _ _A **chain** is a [unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement) of [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length) that measures 66 [feet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)), 22 [yards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yard_(unit_of_length)), 100 [links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_(unit)),&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;or 4 [rods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_(unit)) (20.1168 [m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre)). There are 10 chains in a [furlong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furlong), and 80 chains in one [statute mile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_mile). An [acre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre) is the area of 10 square chains (that is, an area of one chain by one furlong). _ _The **rod** or perch or pole is a [surveyor’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying) tool&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;and unit of [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length) equal to ​5 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [yards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yard), 16​&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [feet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(length)), ​&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;320&lt;/sub&gt; of a [statute mile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_mile) or one-fourth of a [surveyor&#39;s chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_(unit)) and 5.0292 [meters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter). The rod is useful as a unit of length because whole number multiples of it can form one [acre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre) of square measure. _ _The **link** (usually abbreviated as &quot;l.&quot;, &quot;li.&quot; or &quot;lnk.&quot;), sometimes called a **Gunter’s link**, is a [unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_unit) of [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length) formerly used in many English-speaking countries. A link is exactly ​&lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt; of a [foot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)), or exactly 7.92 [inches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch) or 20.1168 cm.The unit is based on [Gunter&#39;s chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunter%27s_chain), a metal [chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_(unit)) 66 feet long with 100 links, that was formerly used in land [surveying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying)._ Here is a table to convert links/chains/rods/furlongs to inches/feet/yards/miles and ultimately, for those of us who finally emerged from the middle ages, to meters. alt_text 2.1.6 Deeds and Patents This book contains excerpts from, transcripts of, and links to hundreds of deeds. There are many types of deeds, which are used to register the transfer of real property. There are hundreds of introductions to deeds and types of ownership of real property of the web. A good example is American Bar Association (2011). I only give a brief summary of the types we will encounter in this book. A general warranty deed guarantees that the grantor has clear title, and that no other parties retain an interest in the property. It usually includes various covenants, in particular that the grantor is responsible if it is discovered the title is not clear and third parties makes claims to the property. A_ quitclaim deed_ transfers any interest in the real property that the grantee has to the grantor, without any guarantee that the grantee actually has title to or ownership of the property. Thus the rights of the grantor in the property are transferred to the grantee, provided that the grantor actually has these rights, otherwise the quitclaim deed is just a piece of paper. A sheriff’s deed is a deed that gives ownership rights in property bought at a sheriff’s sale. A sheriff’s sale is a sale conducted by a sheriff upon order of a court after a failure to pay a judgment. These days sheriff’s deeds are used in foreclosures, in the nineteenth century they were used even more often if owners of real property failed to pay taxes or bills for goods and services. The important thing is that a court order was needed. Old newspapers have pages and pages of pieces of real estate sold at sheriff’s sales, mostly because of delinquent property taxes. For US land donations and cash transactions under the homestead law we include and transcribe (in as far as they are readable) a copy of the patent and the corresponding deed. For later transfers of real property we include copies, or links to copies, of all deeds we could find. For this chapter we follow the title chain from the US to the homesteader, and then from the homesteader to all next-stage buyers, until the whole homestead is divided up and sold, and we arrive at the subdivision plats, which eventually all will have their separate chapters in this book. As usual, links to deeds are included, and some deeds, or parts of deeds, are transcribed in the text. Because of the nineteenth century longhand, and because of the quality of the copies and microfilm, it is sometimes impossible to read part of the deed.

Snyder tells us he paid $ 200. That makes sense because under the provisions of the act land was sold for $ 1.25 per acre. The complete transcribed text of the patent (General Land Office Record, 1870) follows. Whereas there has been deposited in the General Land Office of the United States a certificate of the Register of the Land Office at Oregon City, whereby it appears that pursuing to the Act of Congress approved the 20th of May 1862 “To Secure Homesteads to actual Settlers on the public domain”, and the acts supplemental thereto, the claim of Evander Howe has been established and duly consummated in conformity to law for the South West quarter of Section fifteen in Township one North of Range one East in this District of Lands subject to Sale at Oregon City Oregon containing one hundred and sixty acres according to the Official Plat of the Survey of the said Land returned to the General Land Office by the Surveyor General. Now know ye, that there is therefore granted by the United States onto the said Evander Howe the tract of land above described: the Have and To Hold the said tract of land with the appurtenances thereof unto the said Evander Howe and to his heirs and assigns forever. In testimony whereof I, Ulysses S. Grant, President of the United States of America, have caused these letters to be made Patent, and the Seal of the General and Office to be hereunto affixed.

The blue Evander Howe square, half a mile by half a mile, in the southwest corner is bounded by what is now Interstate Avenue, Kerby Avenue, Killingsworth Street, and Rosa Parks Way. Parts are in modern Piedmont (within the red boundaries), parts are in Humboldt, Overlook, and Arbor Lodge. 2.2.2 Sales Evander Howe sold eighty acres on July, 5 1870 for four hundred dollars to Elizabeth Smith, who, together with her husband George Smith, owned the 160 acres to the east since March 10, 1866. The eighty acres Evander sold to the Smiths were the lower half of the blue quadrant, i.e. the part in modern Humboldt and Overlook.

There is no Estey Howe, I think. Also, there is no Battleboro in Vermont, although there is a Brattleboro. Snyder was misinformed by the Evander Howe probate file, which mentions one Estey Howe as a possible sole heir. As we have seen, that should be Ezra Howe, and there were others. On December 27, 1883 George Woodward and Ellen M. Woodward, his wife, quitclaimed for one dollar an undivided one-third interest in the northern 80 acres to assembly and councilman Sylvester Farrell, of Everding &amp; Farrell, a huge wholesale produce, shopping, grain, salmon, and logging company. And on the same day they also transferred another undivided one-third interest in the northern half of the southwest quarter to local undertaker and capitalist Edward Holman for another dollar. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uheS9b7nigCNVkVcf4-3Ve6vU0F7mASU https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_inDXj_kQkbhkHclvA2Fw-oLh-jv_QzC August 17, 1887 a one-third interest was transferred from Farrell to Everding &amp; Farrell for $ 2,500. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LqahDe7DqF0VmlcNryMhDq1OUgd9WXNK On January 3, 1890 S.

The land had increased in value from $ 100 in 1870 to $ 40,000 in 1890. Of course very little of that appreciation benefited Evander Howe, although some of it benefited his heirs in Vermont. In other places in this book I will discuss what the Ukase Investment Company did with their 80 acres. They leased some of the land to Harry Bush for Evergreen Park and to the City for the Municipal Automobile Park. They sold some of the land to the school district for Ockley Green School and to the City for Peninsula Park. And they used 25 of the 80 acres to plat and develop the Gainsborough Addition. As we have seen the southern half of Evander Howe’s quadrant was not in Piedmont. The eastern part of this southern half became West Piedmont and Jarrett’s Addition, the western part became North Albina. 2.3 Homesteaders: Evander Howe 2.3.1 Life In the 1860s Evander Howe came from Vermont to Oregon. He does not appear even once in any of the Oregon newspapers from the time period. Eugene E. Snyder _(1989, p. 114) _says No record tells us what sort of man Evander Howe was, nor how he occupied his time in Oregon. As I began this research it was unclear when and where he was born and how old he was when he died. There is not much information, but there is a bit more than nothing. Snyder mentions he has no idea what Howe tried or did during his final years, or if he was even in Portland. But I found him in the 1880 census. He was enumerated on July 14, a 45 year old farmer living in the Willamette Precinct. The name was transcribed as Evanden, but the census form is pretty clear. His neighbor on the form is the 52 year old farmer John Hott (sic). That should actually be John Hotts. Both of them were single. Evander apparently lived alone, Hotts had a hired hand living at the same address. Another neighbor on the same census form is Davis Ulery (sic), a 49 year old farmer, with a large family. That should actually be David Ulery. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UG_QRBABD8gPf79ShC7yWP__qr3oubIK/view 2.3.2 Death Snyder tells us Evander Howe died in 1882. Initially, I was not able to find the precise date of death, or the location of the grave. But there is much useful information, as is often the case, in the probate file (Case number 858, Multnomah Court Records, 56 pages). https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xs6X_Qrkn7oQ42qUxIBs0PgluGlfWPlM As I have remarked elsewhere, probate files and cemetery records often make it easier to find out facts about a person’s death than about their life. This is partly because they arrived from different places, but they all died in Portland. Also, their birth and childhood often were lived in areas that were not yet incorporated and did not have state, county, or city administrative offices. And thirdly, there is just more bureaucratic and journalistic activity around estates and deaths than around births or marriages, partly because often the heirs tend to get into elaborate fights amongst themselves. This is, of course, especially true for large estates, because greed needs a substrate to grow on. So what did I learn from the probate file ? Evander Howe died intestate on June 24, 1882. Thus the court had to appoint an administrator to oversee the appraisal and distribution of the estate. In order to get the job potential administrators petition the court for an appointment, usually pointing out why they were especially suited for the position. In Howe’s case there were two petitioners. The first was R. G. Rex M.D. who was “one of the principal creditors of said deceased”. Also Dr. Rex had some pertinent information. In his petition he gave the precise description of Evander’s real estate, and its estimated value of $ 8,000, and he knew of the existence of “ a brother names Estey Howe residing at or near Brattleboro in Windham County in the State of Vermont.” Nevertheless Dr. Rex lost out to Edward Holman, the funeral and cremation provider, who ran “the second oldest business in Portland”, since 1854. The business still exists. See their website at https://www.holmansfuneralservice.com. There was a great deal of money in funerals, it seems, and Holman became a capitalist, and a very prominent citizen of Portland. Note that soon after he would actually own a half interest in Evander’s land.I don’t think Dr. Rex stood a chance, even though he knew the deceased and Holman did not. In his petition Holman mentioned that Evander Howe had no family in Oregon, or anywhere else, as far as he knew. But he did mention he was the principal creditor of the estate. The firm of A.P. De Lin &amp; Co, of which he was a member, was owned $ 128.00 for funeral services. The bill in question is below. It does not say where the grave was, and I still do not know where A.P. De Lin &amp; Co. generally disposed of the bodies. alt_text Being an administrator required one to agree to a financial penalty if the court found the duties of the administrator were not carried out or the powers of the administrator were misused. In the Evander Howe case Holman had to agree to a penal sum of $ 12,000. He used two sureties, Levi Anderson and councilman Sylvester Farrell, each for $ 6,000. Note again that soon after Sylvester Farrell would own a half interest in Evander’s land. The appraisers were D.W. Wakefield, L.L. Parrish, and T.J. Mattock. They concluded, probably without actually looking at anything, on August 11, 1882 that there was $ 200.00 of cash and $ 8,500.00 of real property (the northern half of the southwest quarter of section 15). In his final report, of August 24, 1882, Holman adds $ 12.45 from the sale of potatoes (which were a common part of agricultural estates) and $ 28.62 from the sale of an old stove and some other personal property. He paid some outstanding bills and charged additional costs to the estate, including a $ 150.00 appraiser fee for himself and a $ 100.00 fee for his lawyer. Here is the list. Clearly Evander Howe lived a minimalist and environmentally responsible life on his piece of the Vancouver Road. alt_text What follows in the probate file are copies of the bills, and various notices from the creditors that the bills were duly paid. More interesting for our purposes is a later note, notarized on March 22, 1883, and written by Edward Holman’s attorney to Judge Stearns. It shows that George Woodward, perhaps taking a hint from the petition of Dr. Rex, had found the family. Edward Holman, Sylvester Farrell, and W. K. Smith were waiting in the wings to start buying and selling the land. alt_text 2.3.3 Family We have seen earlier that Evander’s family lived in Vermont. In the 1850 Federal Census I found Joseph Gilman Howe, a farmer, born 1809, married to Priscilla Howe (née Spalding) and living in Jamaica, Windham County, Vermont. They have five children living at home: Evander, age 15, Hannibal, age 12, Louisa, age 10, Lovina, age 7, and Sarah, age 4. Thus Evander was the oldest son. The Vermont Vital Records show his birth date was March 12, 1834. It also shows the middle initial T. which disappeared over time. alt_text https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B94Urj3OjM7BeldUckFKSUx0blk/view Evander’s profession at 15 was listed by the census as farmer, like his dad. In the 1860 census Evander (transcribed as Elander) was 24, still living at home, a laborer. There is now also an eight year old brother Ezra Olander Howe. I also found a record in the Minnesota Territorial Census of September 21, 1857, showing an Evander Howe, age 23, born in Vermont in 1834, living in Township 109 in the County of Nicollet. He was a laborer on the farm of Luke Rist, who was also from Vermont. And in the Minnesota Homestead and Cash Entry Patents Evander Howe bought 27.62 acres of land in Blue Earth, Nicollet County, on October 1, 1860. The land office that handled the sale was in St Peter, another town in Nicollet County. Even more impressively, on December 3, 1860, Sarah Knecht, formerly the widow of Henry Stone, who was a private in Captain Wilson’s Company of the Pennsylvania Militia in the War of 1812, used the Military Bounty Act of 1855 to claim 120 acres of land in Nicollet County. She then assigned the warrant to H.W. Lamberton, who subsequently passed it on to Evander Howe. So clearly around this time Evander was moving west and had acquired some property on the way. I have copies of both patent deeds, but since they are a bit far from our bed, and transcribing them is boring, I will just give the URLs in the references. I have no idea what Evander did between 1860 and 1870. In the 1880 census Joseph G. Howe is a widower, who lives with his daughter-in-law Maria and two grandchildren, still in Jamaica, Vermont. There is no sign of Hannibal, Maria’s husband. It is mentioned in the census that Joseph is sick of old age. He died 1882, 74 years old, in the same year as his oldest son Evander. The Vermont Probate Records of 1882 show that the administrator of his estate asks permission of the probate court to sell all real estate belonging to the deceased to satisfy his debtors. There is a debt of $ 698.77 and a personal estate of only $ 8.50. The 8000 dollars that Geo. Woodward paid to Evander Howe’s siblings came too late to help Joseph Howe. alt_text https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B94Urj3OjM7BekM0bEtsUWxjXzg/view 2.3.4 References Eugene E.

In the second step the Ulery’s sold lot 5, the part in Section 14, currently in Woodlawn, to Silas Jones for $ 1,050. The deed was recorded on December 19, 1881. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1C2Y59TD9k1_Jpt4FgoAvi7_1Oyme24PM The next deed records the sale of 25 acres to Lewis Washington Love, son of William Love, and grandson of Lewis Love. It was recorded on February 1, 1882. Know all men by these Presents : That we David Ulery and Martha J Ulery wife of said David Ulery of the County of Multnomah and State of Oregon, in consideration of Seven hundred (700) dollars to us paid by Lewis W. Love of said Multnomah County State of Oregon do hereby grant bargain sell and convey to said Lewis W. Love and to his heirs and assigns forever the following described parcel of real estate to wit: Being a part of Section Fifteen (15) in Township One (1) North Range One (1) East of Willamette Meridian and bounded as follows to wit: Beginning at a stake on the boundary line between sections fourteen (14) and fifteen (15) in said Township and on the South boundary of the Lewis Love Donation Land Claim and running from thence South eighteen (18) chains and eighteen (18) links to the quarter Section post between said sections fourteen and fifteen.

I used a modern map to draw the boundaries on, but of course none of the streets were there in 1882, except Vancouver Road. Also, there is no guarantee that the boundaries are precise to within the millimeter, but it’s a pretty good approximation. alt_text [https://drive.google.com/open?id=18J7V0CGXE1adVcPZOBAwwANgSH4XmGJj](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18J7V0CGXE1adVcPZOBAwwANgSH4XmGJj) Compare this with a modern subdivision map. We see that the Lewis Love piece was subdivided into Beverly and Piedmont Park. The Florence Mead part became Saratoga. The Sarah McMillen part became Kirkmar, Nocera, and the Gerard Addition, as well as the Holy Redeemer complex. The Terzah McMillen part became the Gem Addition and Devine’s Addition. The John Hotts part became Lahoma, Lochinvar, Cumberland, Pacific Place, Parkway, New Albina, and the Rose Addition. alt_text The David Ulery homestead illustrates clearly the general mechanism of larger pieces of land being sold in smaller pieces, introducing more owners, and eventually resulting in many subdivisions from a small number of homesteads. More to the north the Lewis Love DLC was partitioned into relatively large pieces, but the David Ulery DLC became fractured early on. This partitioning into subdivisions also allows us to answer discomforting existential questions such as “Why does NE Rodney Ave not continue in a straight line at Bryant ?” or “Why does NE Saratoga St stop at its east end before it gets to NE Rodney Ave ?”. 2.4.3 Sales (Second Phase) In the first phase of sales we started with a military donation claim of 144 acres, consisting of four tax lots of 37 acres. It was divided into six parcels, of which five were in the modern Piedmont neighborhood. As I indicated in the introduction, I will actually try to follow the title chains to the next level, where these five larger parcels will be partitioned into subdivisions. Bear with me, this will get complicated. Nobody in the first set of buyers (John Hotts, Sarah McMillen, Terzah McMillen, Florence Meade, Lewis Washington Love) thought of actually platting and developing the land. The second phase started at the time of the consolidation of Albina, the relentless boosting by McKenna, Killingsworth, and Quackenbush, and the coming of bridges, railways, and streetcars on the East Side. All these parcels rapidly went up in value when Piedmont was platted in 1889. Sales picked up, plats were filed, and early investors made a nice profit. In many cases buyers sold in the same year they bought, and nevertheless making a considerable profit. 2.4.3.1 Lewis Washington Love alt_text Let’s start with the twenty five acres that Lewis Washington Love bought from Ulery. He sold them for $ 3,125 to W. G. Jenne on September 22, 1882. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AeyvCQDgk2Hzsy2hiAAmePk9hGdAOprF 2.4.3.1.1 Piedmont Park On February 20, 1889 W. G. and Ida J.

Stearns for $ 7,500. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Bnm-HAauK5hZohLcjlSqln5wZOVRW13f There is an interesting clause in the deed. … together with the right of road over the east 30 feet of the 10 acre tract of land adjoining the south boundary of above conveyed tract of land and saving and excepting a like right of road over the said 15 acre tract above conveyed, said rights to last till both of said tracts are made accessible by public road to both the Woodlawn Station and the Vancouver road and no longer. G. W. and Josephine C. Stearns in turn sold the parcel for $ 9,000 to D. B. Monteith on February 26, 1889.

I have not figured this one out completely yet. Clearly Jenne was unable or forgot to pay his property taxes, because Sheriff George C. Sears sold the parcel on November 26, 1894 to E.S. Rash for $ 50.00. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1c_R6kSraX5bRp-F_YsVsRYNX86PdHE6- https://drive.google.com/open?id=18GqNBpgRIBQskNp7KwteuuQvzoJh2xT1 2.4.3.2 Florence Meade alt_text 2.4.3.2.1 Saratoga The 13.38 acres that are now Saratoga have a relatively simple story. We have seen they were sold by the Ulery’s to Florence Meade for $ 1,200 on February 1, 1882. W. H. and Florence Meade in turn sold them for $ 2,750 to Julius E. Sorbin of Albany on October 17, 1882. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KLX7BJODfJs3j9rXvTBeuPeE3nSyj8CU Sorbin quitclaimed them to Hardy C.

Both Mr. Wortman and the Saratoga subdivision have their separate chapters in this book. 2.4.3.3 Sarah McMillen alt_text The 25 acres that Sarah McMillen bought from the Ulery’s for $ 2,500 on February 1, 1882 were transferred on August 5 of the same year by R.

The probate file for George Marshal shows basically that at his death there was nothing left in the estate, and the executor of the estate (his wife) had an easy job. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sHPTMHOAw8sQwdT8zWILltRa6XS1AZS7 2.4.3.3.1 Kirkmar There are two Margaretta Marshalls to be considered. The first is Margaretta Kirk-Marshall, who died in 1897. She left an estate worth almost $ 100,000, mostly consisting of real property, but the parcel in the Piedmont Neighborhood was not mentioned in the probate file. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1f7eJnJneqAYa3_yv-8K96VM1CYHH2O96 The second Margaretta is the daughter Margaretta A. Marshall, who in April 1929, with her sister Vidae L. Marshall and her niece M. Genevieve Jones, platted the 8.08 acres of the western part of the Sarah McMillan parcel, between Congress and Vancouver, as Kirkmar. Presumably the name Kirkmar is derived from Kirk-Marshall. The 100 by 450 feet chunk (1.03 acres) at Congress ? Why ? Must have been sold by Marshall’s rather early on. 2.4.3.3.2 Nocera The eastern part. First the 2 ⅚ acres that later becomes Nocera. Beginning on the quarter section line running east and west through the center of section 15, in Township one (1) north of range one (1) east, at a point 1130 feet west of the east line of said section; which said point is at the southwest corner of a parcel of land containing three and one-sixth (3 ⅙) acres heretofore conveyed to one Gustave M.

I am still pretty far from resolving all the transactions for that parcel between 1882 and the final plats around 1920, but eventually I’ll get there. It started out relatively simple. On December 27, 1882 John Hotts sold 40 acres to a consortium consisting of L. D. Brown, J. A. Strowbridge, H. J. Morrison, James C. Tolman, Edmond F. Lewis, and William P. Wright. The first four had an undivided ⅕ interest, Lewis and Wright had an undivided 1/10 interest. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VHw9Ig8Qpyy7W0kbQzZjydlQs7z2-bJy Now, of course, 40 acres is more than 37.72 acres. No magick was involved, however. In 1862 John Hotts had also bought from John Finstermacher the 67.38 acres that bordered the Ulery homestead on the west side. Remember the DLC map I already showed earlier in this chapter. Tax lots 1, 2, 3, and 5 south of the Lewis Love DLC are Ulery’s homestead, while lot 5 to the west of the Love DLC is in Finstermacher’s homestead. Things become complicated because of lot 4 in the southwest corner, which is in Finstermacher’s homestead, but is not entirely to the west of Love. The part that is south of the Love DLC is exactly the part in the current Piedmont neighborhood. On modern maps the south boundary of both Ulery and Finstermacher is Rosa Parks Way. The north boundary of Ulery is Bryant Street and the north boundary of Finstermacher’s lot 5 is Lombard Street. alt_text Story of New Albina. 2.4.3.5.1 Rose Addition.

Sold to Ernest Cawston (her brother) Feb 1905. 2.5 Homesteaders: David and Martha Jane Ulery 2.5.1 Paddy Carr We have seen that military bounty land was often passed on by the beneficiaries, undoubtedly for a small fee, to persons with more money and more of an idea of what to do with the land. This was certainly the case with MW-0229-025, where the bounty land was given to a Native American warrior. The patent says A-Chars-War-Chee was one of the 500 Creek volunteers in Captain Paddy Carr’s Company in the Creek War. This is fascinating to me, so I went off on a tangent, and did some more digging. There is very little hope to find any further information about A-Chars-War-Chee, but Paddy Carr is another matter. There are two Paddy Carr’s in the local history from around 1800 in Georgia. The first one emigrated from Ireland around 1767, started his career as an indian trader, and participated in guerilla warfare in the Revolutionary War. He was known throughout the South as “Captain Paddy Carr”and the troops he commanded consisted of dragoons and riflemen and were known as “Carr’s Independent Corps” and are sometimes referred to as “Carr’s Legion.”(O’Brien, 1922, p 93) Since the first Paddy Carr died in 1802, he cannot possibly have participated in the Creek “Red Stick” War, which was in 1813-1814 (Wikipedia, Creek War). According to the Irish historians, the second Paddy was the son of the first one. The Creek War referred to in the patent must have been the Second Creek War in Florida in 1836 (Wikipedia, Creek War of 1836), and the Paddy Carr mentioned must have been the son. Major Carr married a Creek woman and had a son named Patrick, who, like his father, was always known as “Paddy” Carr. In 1826 “Paddy” accompanied a delegation of Indians to Washington and acted as interpreter. He too became a soldier and in 1836 when the Creeks rose he took the side of the United States and marched to Florida with General Jessup at the head of 500 warriors and helped in the suppression of the Indian revolt (O’Brien, 1922, p 95) alt_text https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OvngfWlXkBOrMQyUwMzWSniiC5CxKiNe We even have a beautiful portrait of the second Paddy Carr, from the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery, done by Alfred M. Hoffy in 1838. More information about this second Paddy Carr is in McKenney and Hall (1838, p 223-225). It documents his trip as interpreter to Washington, his subsequent career as a trader, slaveholder, and landed gentleman, and his leading of 500 warriors in the Florida campaign. The young Paddy was born near Fort Mitchell, in Alabama, and, in his infancy, was taken into the family of Colonel Crowell, the Indian agent, and kindly reared in the habits of civilised life (p 223). Soon after his return from Washington, he married the daughter of Colonel Lovett, a respectable half breed, with whom he received a portion which, with the property accumulated by himself, furnished a capital sufficient to enable him to go into trade. In a few years he amassed a considerable property, and is now, in 1837, possessed of from seventy to eighty slaves, besides landed property, and a large stock of horses and cattle. (p 223) Paddy Carr has an innate passion for fine horses, and owns a large number of very valuable animals. He is fond of racing, and, when he has a trial of speed depending, if he cannot suit himself with a rider, he rides his own horse. He is of a liberal and generous disposition, hospitable to strangers, and kind to the poor. Many of the poorer class of Indians depend on him for support. He has three wives, one of whom is daughter of the ill fated General McIntosh. The two first born of his children were twin girls, and Captain Crowell, the son of his early friend and patron, having a daughter named Ariadne, he called one of his twins Ari and the other Adne, thus evincing a sense of benefits received, which is in itself one of the highest evidences of a noble mind. (p 224) Enough of Paddy Carr, and back to the main characters of this chapter. 2.5.2 Life and Death The book by Alley (1885, p. 381) has a short biographical sketch describing David Ulery. I assume Alley actually talked to Ulery, because his book was “compiled from the most authentic sources”. The subject of this sketch was born in Fayette county, Pennsylvania, May 11, 1831, but when fifteen years of age removed to Wheeling, Ohio county, West Virginia, where he was engaged in steamboating. He afterwards joined his parents in Muscatine county, Iowa, and subsequently moved to Minneapolis, and thence to Crawford county, Wisconsin, and there was married to Miss Martha J. Alcorn. In the spring of 1861 he emigrated to California via the isthmus of Panama, and after remaining in Sacramento until July of that year he came to Portland, Oregon, settled on the road between that city and Vancouver and engaged in fruit and vegetable raising for the Portland market. Disposing of that place in 1882, he took up his residence in Clark county, Washington Territory, and in the month of March took possession of the farm he now occupies in the Chelachie valley. His family consists of one son and three daughters, viz. John H., Mary, Rosa and Lena. Note that Ulery bought the farm one month after receiving 1050 + 1200 + 1200 + 2500 + 700 = 6650 dollars from the sale of his donation land claim in Multnomah County. I am pretty sure that was quite a lot more than he paid A-Chars-War-Chee for the patent. While living on Vancouver road, David Ulery was active in various public-minded activities. He served on juries and councils, and interacted with his neighbors Evander Howe, John Hotts, William Love, George Smith, and Lewis Love, all of them featuring in various chapters of this book. If appraisals were needed, or documents signings needed to be witnessed, then the neighbors helped each other, undoubtedly also because they were the only people around, living in an isolated area, far from the city. In the Willamette Farmer of March 7, 1874, we see Ulery as active in the Grange movement “a fraternal organization in the United States that encourages families to band together to promote the economic and political well-being of the community and agriculture” (Wikipedia). It’s like a rural neighborhood association. alt_text We can also follow David Ulery through the pages of the federal and state censuses. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1U8VH0G83sIc_dwDzT9OUADiaEczNtpy2 In 1850 he was 19 years old, living with his parents in Marshall county, Virginia. His profession was listed as cooper. His future wife Martha Jane Alcorn was 14, and living with her parents in Kiskiminetas, Armstrong, Pennsylvania. In 1870 Ulery was a farmer in the Willamette precinct, Multnomah county, owning $ 2,500 worth of real estate, and accompanied by his wife and children John (12) , Mary (8), Rosa (7), Benj (4) and Lisor Ann (2). In the 1880 federal census Rosa Ann (16), Benjamin (14), and Lissa (12) are still at home. In the 1900 federal census the children are not there anymore, and husband and wife are in Chelatchie county in Washington. They are by now 69 and 64 years old, and the census informs us that of their six children only three are still alive. In the 1910 census David and Martha are 76 and 74. After that, no more. alt_text The records of the Chelatchi Cemetery in Amboy, Washington (established 1892) show alt_text 2.5.3 References Michael J.
