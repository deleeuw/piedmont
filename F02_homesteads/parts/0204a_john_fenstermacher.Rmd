On December 21, 1863 the United States registered the sale of 67.38 acres of public land for the usual  $ 1.25 per acre to John Findsermacker, under the provisions of the Act of Congress of the 34th of April, 1820, entitled _“An act making further provision for the sale of public lands”_. For the moment, ignore the fact that the recipients name is spelled differently as the one in the title of this chapter. 

The deed corresponding to the patent was not recorded with Multnomah County until January 17, 1880.

The precise description of the land is


>    _The Fractional West Half of the North West quarter of Section Fifteen or the lots numbered Four and Five of Section Fifteen in Township One North of Range One East._

The following small map with donation claims and lot sales makes the description someone clearer.

Note that the west boundary of the Lewis Love DLC corresponds to what is now the I-5 freeway, while the south boundary is Bryant Street. Thus only a tiny sliver of Findsermacker’s land is in modern Piedmont, only about the eastern third of lot 4, in fact about 14 acres. The rest is in modern Arbor Lodge. Also note that the map has an error, because the total acreage for lots 4 and 5 on the map is 28.00 + 38.38 = 66.38, while the patent specifies that Fenstermacher bought 67.38 acres. It looks as if the original intention was to make lot 4 equal to 20 chains by 20 chains, i.e. a quarter mile by a quarter mile, or 40 acres.

In any case, he did not hold on to it for very long. Thus his role in the history of Piedmont is almost infinitesimal, but his life story is too interesting not to tell.


### Sales

Fenstermacher sold his land on October 27, 1862 to his neighbor John Hotts for $ 100. Remember that he paid 67.38 x 1.25 = 88.23 dollars for it.

Note that the sale to Hotts was registered one year before the legal patent was issued, and a full 18 years before the patent was registered with the county. 

John Hotts sold part of the Fenstermacher homestead to Charles M. Russell for $ 6,740 in 1882. What he actually sold were the 53.92 acres of the 67.38 acres that were not in the current Piedmont neighborhood, i.e. the rectangle west of what is now the freeway. There are actually two deeds registering for this sale. The first is dated May 26, 1882

and the second June 27, 1882

The reason there are two deeds may be the nineteenth century equivalent of a typo. In the first deed the parcel is described as having an east boundary on the line separating sections 9 and 15. That should be sections 10 and 15, of course, and that was duly corrected in the second deed.

As for the 67.38 - 53.92 = 13.46 acres of Fenstermacher’s homestead in modern Piedmont, that part was included in the sale of 40 acres by John Hotts for $ 12,000 to a consortium consisting of Lorenzo D. Brown, J. A. Strowbridge, H. J. Morrison, James C. Tolman, Edmond F. Lewis, and William P. Wright. The first four grantees had a ⅕ interest, the last two a 1/10 interest.  The  remaining 40 - 13.46 = 26.54 acres came from the 37.72 acres (i.e. lot 3 on our little map) John Hotts bought from his other neighbor David Ulery on May 2, 1863.

On January 19, 1883 the same six gentlemen platted their 40 acre parcel as the New Albina subdivision. For some reason New Albina never got developed as such, and the land was partitioned, sold off, and later platted as the smaller subdivisions Cumberland, Parkway, Pacific Place, Lahoma, and Lochinvar. These later sales are more appropriately discussed in the David Ulery homestead chapter.
