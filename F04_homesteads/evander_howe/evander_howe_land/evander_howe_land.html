Woodward, his wife, quitclaimed for one dollar an undivided one-third interest in the northern 80 acres to assembly and councilman Sylvester Farrell, of Everding &amp; Farrell, a huge wholesale produce, shopping, grain, salmon, and logging company. And on the same day they also transferred another undivided one-third interest in the northern half of the southwest quarter to local undertaker and capitalist Edward Holman for another dollar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/open?id%3D1uheS9b7nigCNVkVcf4-3Ve6vU0F7mASU&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1630354869973000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1JtwlRjnW8gN9OZsSWOJwv">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uheS9b7nigCNVkVcf4-3Ve6vU0F7mASU</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/open?id%3D1_inDXj_kQkbhkHclvA2Fw-oLh-jv_QzC&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1630354869974000&amp;usg=AOvVaw31TfvMuu5_p5jg0b3Tg2bj">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_inDXj_kQkbhkHclvA2Fw-oLh-jv_QzC</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">August 17, 1887 a one-third interest was transferred from Farrell to Everding &amp; Farrell for $ 2,500.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/open?id%3D1LqahDe7DqF0VmlcNryMhDq1OUgd9WXNK&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1630354869974000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0cDG376GrC7WlKQDf120Mr">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LqahDe7DqF0VmlcNryMhDq1OUgd9WXNK</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">On January 3, 1890 S.

The land had increased in value from </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">$ 100 in 1870 to $ 40,000 in 1890. Of course very little of that appreciation benefited Evander Howe, although some of it benefited his heirs in Vermont.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">In other places in this book I will discuss what the Ukase Investment Company did with their 80 acres. They leased some of the land to Harry Bush for Evergreen Park and to the City for the Municipal Automobile Park. They sold some of the land to the school district for Ockley Green School and to the City for Peninsula Park. And they used 25 of the 80 acres to plat and develop the Gainsborough Addition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">As we have seen the southern half of Evander Howe&rsquo;s quadrant was not in Piedmont.
