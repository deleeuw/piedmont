On March 19, 1866 the United States, under the Oregon-Donation act, granted a 635.77 acres donation land claim to Lewis and Nancy M. Love. The normal allocation of 160 acres was doubled because both husband and wife applied, and doubled again because they arrived in Oregon in 1849. The copy of the patent is hard to read, so I have transcribed what I could decipher below.


>    _Whereas there has been deposited in the GENERAL LAND OFFICE of the UNITED STATES a Certificate numbered Fourteen hundred and eighty-four of the Register and Receiver at Oregon City, Oregon whereby it appears that under the provisions of the act of Congress approved the 27th day of September 1850, entitled “An Act to create the office of Surveyor General of the Public Lands in Oregon and to provide for the survey and to make donations to settlers of the said public lands” and the legislation supplemental thereto the claim of Lewis Love and his wife Nancy M. Love of Multnomah County, Oregon, Notification No 293 has been established to a donation of one section of six hundred and forty acres of land, that the same has been surveyed and designated as Claim number forty-one, being parts of sections ten, eleven, fourteen, and fifteen in Township one North, of Range one East, according to the Official Plat of Survey retained to the GENERAL LAND OFFICE by the SURVEYOR GENERAL being ??? and described as follows to wit: beginning at a point fourteen chains East of the South West corner of ??? section ten and running thence North sixty-seven chains and eighty links; thence South twenty-two degrees East eighty-eight chains and seventy links; thence South sixty-two chains and ten links; thence North eighty-nine degrees and thirty minutes West; and thence North twenty-one chains to the point of beginning in the district of Sandy, subject to sale at Oregon City, Oregon, containing six hundred and thirty-five acres and seventy-eight hundredth of an acre._


>    _Now know ye that the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA in consideration of the premises and in conformity with the provisions of the act aforesaid HAVE GIVEN AND GRANTED and by those presents DO GIVE AND GRANT unto the said Lewis Love and to his heirs the East half and unto his wife the said Nancy M. Love and her heirs the West half of the tract of land above described to have and to hold the said tract, with the appurtenances, unto the said Lewis Love and his wife Nancy M. Love and to their heirs and assigns forever, ??? respective ??? as aforesaid._

The northwest corner of the parcel makes a 78˚ angle, and the south line is very slightly skewed at an angle of 89˚30’. Check out Bryant Street on modern maps of Portland, because Bryant follows the south boundary of the Lewis Love DLC. The distance between Morgan and Bryant is larger at Martin Luther King Jr Blvd than it is at the I5 Freeway.

### Sales

In his long career Lewis Love bought many parcels of land, in downtown Portland, in various outlying Oregon counties, and in Clark County, Washington. He also sold these properties, often making a large profit. But his original donation land claim remained intact, in fact it grew somewhat over the years. He did not sell, and he seemed to fiercely protect its integrity. But after his death in 1903, everything went pear shaped. He had made a will in 1899 (see [De Leeuw, 2018](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pLI6licAfG6i3ooBr-95lArIwOkYXDUm16BpxombkAA)). His heirs were prohibited by the will from selling their shares of the estate until 1907, but they immediately started to convert land to money. In fact, some of them sold their claims to the estate that were defined in the will, even if it was not executed yet.

To understand the division of the land the will indicates the parcel was about 750 acres. Initially the executors of the will T. T. Struble and Philo Holbrook tried to sell the whole tract. It is unclear to me if they were required to do this by law, or if the heirs had decided it is easier to divide up money than it is to divide up land. In any case, here are two ads from the Oregonian of March 31, 1903 and March 1, 1907.

Now $ 500 per acre would make the tract $ 375,000 -- a gigantic amount of money in 1903. The usual inflation calculators show that this would be about ten million dollars in 2018. But on the other hand, those ten million dollars in 2018 will barely buy you 25 houses in the modern Piedmont neighborhood.

Selling the whole 750 acres as a single tract did not work, and the executors had to divide up the land. Now I am not sure how this was actually done, but given the final results I can make a fair guess. Lewis and Nancy Love had four surviving children (Fred, Lewis, Green, Mary) and two deceased children with progeny (William, Malinda). Thus the estate was divided in six parts, with the surviving children getting one sixth each, and the grandchildren dividing up the two other sixths that would have come to their parents. If we ignore the other real estate and the personal property, then each sixth would be about 120 acres. This corresponds with the six vertical strips of about 120 acres that were later platted and subdivided from west to east as Fairview (from Minnesota to Albina), Swinton (from Albina to Kerby), Lovewood plus Green C. Love Addition (from Kerby to Vancouver), Loveleigh (from Vancouver to Rodney), Love’s Addition (From Rodney to Union), and El Tovar (from Union to Eight Street). So that’s our model, which is probably approximate. Six vertical tracts going to the six heirs, with the two sets of grandchildren acting as a single heir. My next job is to find the deeds that either verify or falsify this model.

Because there were many heirs, and because inheritances tend to make people greedy and irrational, there are many deeds to be considered. I have not found them all yet, but I’ll continue to make a valiant effort. I will also try to indicate which piece of the original DLC was sold and to whom, all the way up to the final plat.

Let’s start with the eastern strip, which is not in Piedmont but in Woodlawn (and Sunderland). On August 12, 1908 Lewis P. Love and his wife Mattie M. Love sold the 48.19 acres bounded by Union Avenue to the west, Bryant Street to the south, Eight Street to the east, and the ONR railroad tracks to the North to Elias Brong from $ 72.000.

These 48.19 acres were platted by the Brong-Steele Company immediately after the sale on August 28, 1908 as the El Tovar subdivision.

On October 29, 1910 they sold the remaining 52.26 acres north of the railroad tracks to the same Elias Brong for a nominal amount of $ 10. ($ 83,616)

The second strip, from Union on the east to Rodney on the west was the part that came to Mary Stafford. On August 8, 1908 the plat for Love’s Addition was filed. This was for the 46.18 acres south of the railroad, with of course Bryant as the southern boundary. The Stafford branch of the Love family did not sell to a developer first, but they themselves became the developers. The plat was filed by Mary C. Stafford, her surviving children, and their husbands/wives if available.

On October 28, 1916 the same Mary C. Stafford and children recorded the plat for the northern half of the strip, from the railway track to the Slough, as an extension of Love’s Addition. Not much of that tract was actually developed as intended, because Love’s Addition north of the railway tracks remained mainly industrial.

If we travel west, to the third strip, matters become slightly more complicated. The 50.49 acres bounded by Rodney, Vancouver, Bryant, and the railroad tracks were sold to Elias Brong, basically by the children of William Love for $ 63,075.

More precisely, the sellers are Ulysses G. Love (unmarried), D. J. Buckley (unmarried), Lewis W. Love and Alice R. Love his wife, Charles W. Love and Elizabeth Love his wife, and Frank P. Love and Annie Love his wife. If we compare this with the surviving sons mentioned in the will of Lewis Love, we see that John A. Love is missing. The reason is simple. John A. Love and Catherine A. Love his wife sold their 1/30 share of the Lewis Love estate to D. J. Buckley for $ 10,000 on June 18, 1904. They couldn’t wait until 1908.

Those 50.49 acres were platted by Brong-Steele as Loveleigh on March 27, 1908.

The section of 101.48 acres between Vancouver and Rodney, north of the railroad and south of  the Slough, was sold by the same parties to the Columbia Trust Company on March 8, 1909, for the nominal sum of $ 10.

Going further west to strip number four brings us to the land inherited by the reverend Green C. Love.
