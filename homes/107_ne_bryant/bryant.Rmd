## Land

At the time of his death Captain Lewis Love had expanded the original 640 acres of his 1850 donation land claim to 757 acres. The original claim was bounded by (what is now) Eight Street to the east, the I-5 freeway to the west, the Columbia Slough to the north, and Bryant Street to the south. The parcels he added, which were part of the original Switzler donation land claims, were between the Columbia Slough and the Columbia River. After Lewis Love’s death in 1903 the 750+ acres were divided up among his six children Lewis, Mary, William, Green, Fred, and Malinda (William and Malinda had died, so their piece of the pie went to their surviving children). This resulted in six vertical strips of land, each of about 125 acres, from (what is now) Bryant Street in the south to the Columbia Slough in the north. In this note we are mainly interested in the strip between Union Avenue (now MLK) and (what is now) Rodney Avenue. It went to Mary Love (by that time Mary Stafford). 


## 


## Plats and Streets

It is important to understand that all this land was just land. There was nothing on it, only scrubs, bushes, and trees. There was, however, some development to the south (Piedmont Park) and to the east (Woodlawn). Piedmont Park was platted in 1891 by J.P and Louisa M. Menefee, F. W. and Ida E. Torgler, and Charles and Emma Woodcock. Here is the plat map. The strip of land inherited by Mary Stafford starts directly north of Piedmont Park.

![alt_text](images/image2.png "image_tooltip")


The platting of Piedmont Park happened just before the Great Street Renaming of January 12, 1892, which was made necessary by the annexation of Albina and East Portland into the City of Portland. Columbus Avenue became Dekum Avenue and Margaretta Avenue became Union Avenue. A Street became Garfield Avenue and B Street became Mallory Street. Woodlawn Avenue became Woodlawn Street, and Rodney Avenue became Hendricks Avenue. The new names and the old names are on this map from 1892.

![alt_text](images/image3.png "image_tooltip")


Note that Union Avenue north of Piedmont was not really a street yet, just the thought of a street. None of the streets in this map were actually paved, and only a small percentage of the lots in the blocks of these subdivisions actually had houses. In 1904 Hendricks Avenue became Rodney Avenue (again !) and in 1907 Woodlawn Street became Bryant Street.


## 


## Grid Deviations

I will take this opportunity to discuss some peculiar deviations from the grid pattern in the Bryant-Rodney-Saratoga area.  Here is a piece of a Portland Maps.

![alt_text](images/image4.png "image_tooltip")


Saratoga dead-ends going east before it reaches Rodney. Going north, Rodney Avenue seems to end at Bryant Street. It does not really, because it picks up again one city block to the west. If you go straight north at Bryant the street continues as Rodney Court, which ends at Morgan.

Saratoga was platted in 1889 by H. C. Wortman, co-owner of the famous Olds, Wortman & King department store downtown. The east boundary of the subdivision is named Albemarle Street, which did not exist at the time and has never existed. It was consequently ignored by Menefee et al, when they platted Piedmont Park two years later. In the 1892 renaming Belmont Avenue in Saratoga became Dekum Avenue. Congress Street became Cleveland Avenue and Windsor Street became Williams Avenue.

To see what happened with Rodney Avenue, we will look at the plat of Love’s Addition. It was recorded on August 8, 1908 by a whole bunch of people.

![alt_text](images/image7.png "image_tooltip")


In this list Lewis G. Stafford, Emma J. Walker, Alistress L. Peacher, Nancy M. Finke, Sarah R. Anderson, Lena G. Richmond, and Sidelia F. Hohmann were all children of Mary C. Stafford. The Schuldermanns and the Radkes are not related, afaik. They came into the picture because in their eagerness to turn the inherited land into money, some pieces of the land had been sold by the heirs. From the Oregonian of July 21, 1908:

The following map shows the southern part of Love’s Addition.



<p id="gdcalert9" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image9.png).

![alt_text](images/image9.png "image_tooltip")


We now see the problem with Rodney Avenue. North of Bryant Street it forms the border between Love’s Addition and Loveleigh, which was platted around the same time. South of Bryant Street, Rodney Avenue comes up through the existing subdivision of Piedmont Park, slightly east of the boundary of Love’s Addition and Loveleigh. Putting in Camden Street did not really solve the problem, and Camden Street was renamed to Rodney Court in 1922, and to NE Rodney Court in the Great Renumbering of 1932. The 1932 change thus merely added the NE to the name (as it did to all streets in the area).


## Bryant Area Lots

Obviously the purpose of plat a subdivision is to create lots, which eventually must be sold. It seems that the Stafford family divided the lots in Love’s Addition amongst the many individuals, family or not, who recorded the plat. In the sequel we shall concentrate on Block 19, lots 7-9, which is a fairly large parcel of 14,407 square feet.  It fell to Sidelia Frances Hohmann. We know this because The Oregon Daily Journal of August 25, 1913 has a list of all those people in Multnomah County who are in arrears on their property taxes. The two Stafford sisters mentioned did not pay for their lots in Love’s Addition, and lots 7-9 in block 19 are in Sidelia’s name.

![alt_text](images/image10.png "image_tooltip")


Next, we want to find out if these three lots actually had a house or houses on it. We can approach this from the present and from the past. Portland Maps tells us that there is now a house on these three lots, which are still a single parcel, with street address 107 NE Bryant Street. If we look at resources from the past we unfortunately cannot use the 1907 Portland Block Book, because it only covers platted subdivisions, and Love’s Addition was not platted yet. This is unfortunate, because the Block Book would tell us for each lot who owned it in 1906. It does not tell us if there was actually a house on the lot. For that we need the Sanborn maps. Again, unfortunately, the 1908 Sanborn maps do not really cover the area north of Bryant, probably because there was not yet any development there. Nothing to insure for Sanborn. Nevertheless, here it is. The structure on the northwest corner of Rodney and Bryant may be some water tower or fire lookout.

![alt_text](images/image11.png "image_tooltip")


Sanborn map number 456 from 1924 is pretty clear, however.

![alt_text](images/image12.jpg "image_tooltip")


There is a house on the three lots, the same house as shown on Portland Maps, with street address 311 Bryant Street. The Great Renumbering of 1932 documents show that 311 Bryant Street did indeed become 107 NE Bryant Street.

![alt_text](images/image13.png "image_tooltip")


Next question. Who built the house and when ? In the Oregon Daily Journal of September 1, 1909 we see a building permit issued to E. J. Price.



<p id="gdcalert14" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image14.png).

![alt_text](images/image14.png "image_tooltip")


No misunderstanding is possible -- there is only one parcel between Rodney and Camden. Portland Maps also tells us the house was built in 1909. Now who was E. J. Price, and how was he/she related to Sidelia Hohmann ?


## 


## Sidelia Stafford-Hohmann-Price-Thode

First, something about Sidelia Stafford, who went by Delia when she was young. She was born February 22, 1876, and thus was 33 years old in 1909. We can track her through the various federal censuses and city directories. Delia Stafford in the 1880 census is 5 years old and lives at home in the Grant district with her carpenter father, her mother, and her six siblings. In the 1893 city directory Delia Stafford was a domestic, living on 353 First Street. But then something happened. In 1896 Delia married George A. Hohmann, a Canadian citizen working as a tin smith or sheet metal worker, and she moved to Astoria. The 1900 census shows her living with George and their two daughters Irene and Alice on Commercial Street in Astoria, in some sort of boarding house or hotel, run by one Palomina Teal. The marriage does not last. Delia moved back to Portland, and in 1907-1908 she lived at the parental home on 325 E. 7th Street. She placed an advertisement in the Oregonian of February 26, 1905.

![alt_text](images/image15.png "image_tooltip")


And, not much later, the Oregonian of January 27, 1907 lets us know she filed for divorce.

<p id="gdcalert16" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image16.png).

![alt_text](images/image16.png "image_tooltip")


It is of some interest that in the Portland City Directories, all the way until 1927, she remains listed as Sidelia F. Hohmann, widow of George A. Hohmann. In the meantime, however, George marries Katie Dreger in June of 1908 and definitely does not die until 1953.

Delia now marries Elijah Price on July 31, 1908. This is obviously the E. J. Price of the building permit. Indeed, the 1910 census shows Elijah and Sidelia Price, with children Irene, Alice, and Walter, living at a house with address 311 Rodney (a mistake by the census taker). The second marriage goes the way of the first. The Oregonian of June 17, 1911 reports the divorce.

![alt_text](images/image17.png "image_tooltip")


On May 3, 1918 Delia, now 42,  married 33 year old Ernest August Thode, a ship filler, if I read the license correctly. This turns out to be a really short marriage. The Oregonian of September 23, 1918 let us know she filed for divorce.



<p id="gdcalert18" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image18.png).

![alt_text](images/image18.png "image_tooltip")


So in the 1920 census we found Sidelia Thode at 311 E. Bryant Street. Daughter Alice, now 20,  still lives at home, and the house is shared with three male lodgers. In the city directories we find Delia still living at 311 Bryant in 1910, 1917, 1924 1927, and 1929. Then there is a gap. I cannot find her in the 1930 census, but in the 1940 census, at age 64, she lives at 341 SW Meade Street in the house of her daughter Irene (then Irene Swaggert).  On July 1, 1955 the Oregonian published a cute picture.

## 


## Ericksons and Grahams

We have followed Delia all the way until she left this earthly coil, but there is still more to tell about the lot and the house at what is now 107 NE Bryant Street.

On September 13, 1930 “_Sidelia F. Thode, a widow, also known as S. F. Thode_”, sold the house for “_ten (10) dollars and other valuable considerations_” to Hjalmar J. Erickson and Irene M. Erickson, husband and wife. The deed says


    _… that the above granted premises are free from all incumbrances except mortgage indebtedness as of record, city liens and taxes, all of which the grantees herein named assume and agree to pay …_


    _[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yfD0fdhuGeJOsEu2g896K2Nwvh2DNy2B](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yfD0fdhuGeJOsEu2g896K2Nwvh2DNy2B)_

Then on July 3, 1935 the North American Life Insurance Company of Chicago sues “_Hjalmar J. Erickson and Irene M. Erickson, Husband and Wife; Merkle Investment Company, and Oregon Corporation; and William L. Graham_” in Multnomah Circuit Court for the foreclosure of a mortgage. The judge in suit number 118384 issues an Execution and Order of Sale for the property, and as a consequence there is a sheriff’s sale on August 5, 1935. The highest bidder at the public auction at the courthouse door is the North American Life Insurance Company, and they take possession for the sum of $ 3038.57, which could be the amount due on the mortgage.

On November 19, 1935 Hjalmar J. Erickson and Irene M. Erickson deeded their remaining interest in the property to the North American Life Insurance Company of Chicago, Illinois, for  “one and no/100 dollars ($ 1.00) and other good and valuable considerations”. The deed stipulated:


    _The intention of this conveyance is to forever bar all the right, title and interest of the above named grantors in and to the above described real property, including their statutory right of redemption from sheriff’s sale in that suit No. 118384, in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for Multnomah County._

There is also a quitclaim on that same November 19, 1935 in which William L. Graham and Eva L. Graham sell their rights to the property for $ 1.00 to the same Life Insurance company.

## Harry A. Montag

And then, on February 19, 1938, Harry A. and Esther Montag bought lots 7 to 9 in block 19 of Love’s Addition, and of course the house on it, from the North American Life Insurance Company Inc. for the nominal sum of ten dollars. Here is a clip of the relevant index file from the Multnomah County Records Office.

![alt_text](images/image21.png "image_tooltip")


The deed specifies that _“the above granted premises are free from all encumbrances, except taxes payable during the year 1938 and balance due on city lien dated July 11, 1928.”_

Somebody, not me, could easily write a book about the history of the Montag family and the Montag business in Portland. For our purposes it suffices to briefly review some of the main facts. The company, known as the Portland Stove Works or the Montag Stove and Furnace Works, was established in 1883 by John Montag on Hood Street. They manufactured more than 300 models of kitchen and heating stoves, and in addition provided parts and repairs for other makes. In addition John Montag was a force in the Democratic Party of Oregon, he served on the executive board as chairman of the Fire Commission for mayors Lane and Pennoyer, and eventually he became a member of the City Council for the sixth ward. 

The Montag firm was family owned and operated until 1955, when it incorporated. There is an article in the Orgonian of January 25, 1955 that shows that the stove works provided gainful employment to many, if not most, male members of the Montag family.

![alt_text](images/image22.png "image_tooltip")


Harry Albert Montag was born in 1896, son of William and Sophia Montag. William (originally Wilhelm) arrived in the US in 1858, married Sophia Petrie in Illinois in 1880, and moved to Portland to join the Montag family business. As an aside, if we go through the census records we see that in both 1910 and 1930 the Montags gave their name as Montague. 

Harry lived at home, at 803 Commercial Street, until at least 1927. He married Esther Olsen in 1924. In the 1930 census their address is 92 Bryant Street, which became 1008 North Bryant Street after the Great Renumbering. We know he sold this home in 1938, and that he had arrived at 107 Northeast Bryant in 1940, accompanied by Esther and his three children Helen, Richard, and Daniel. The Oregonian of September 18, 1938 has a picture of the fairly unassuming house they moved out of.

City directories tell us that the Montags still lived at 107 Northeast Bryant in 1955, but after that the information in the paper and the records on ancestry.com become scarce. Harry lived until 1977 and Esther until 1996, but I am not sure yet where they spent their remaining days, and when 107 Northeast Bryant was sold to the next owner. I will look for the relevant deeds, of course, but for now I’ll stop here.
