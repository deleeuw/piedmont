As I have repeatedly stated in other chapters, I cannot possibly get involved in the history of individual lots and houses. There are simply too many of them. So my history of the land usually stops as soon as the subdivisions are platted. This applies even in the (rare) case in which there is no official plat, but just a strip of land, without cross streets, but with several individual lots.

There are a few exceptions, however. The first one is my own house. And there are some houses which are closely linked to the history of Piedmont, for example because they were built  by members of the Love family. And, finally, I may include some houses in the National Register of Historic Places, although I have not made up my mind about that yet.

Note that buildings and places in Piedmont that are not “houses” are covered in the chapter on “structures”. This includes parks, schools, churches, convents, and so on.
