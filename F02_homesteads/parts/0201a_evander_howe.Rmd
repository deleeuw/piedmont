## Homesteads: Evander Howe


![alt_text](images/0201a_images/image1.png "image_tooltip")


### Homestead

On June 1, 1870, Evander Howe established a claim under the homestead act of 1862 for 160 acres of land, the southwest corner of section 15 in township 1 north, range 1 east. Snyder tells us he paid $ 200. That makes sense because under the provisions of the act land was sold for $ 1.25 per acre. The complete transcribed text of the patent (General Land Office Record, 1870) follows.


>    Whereas there has been deposited in the General Land Office of the United States a certificate of the Register of the Land Office at Oregon City, whereby it appears that pursuing to the Act of Congress approved the 20th of May 1862 "To Secure Homesteads to actual Settlers on the public domain", and the acts supplemental thereto, the claim of Evander Howe has been established and duly consummated in conformity to law for the South West quarter of Section fifteen in Township one North of Range one East in this District of Lands subject to Sale at Oregon City Oregon containing one hundred and sixty acres according to the Official Plat of the Survey of the said Land returned to the General Land Office by the Surveyor General.


> Now know ye, that there is therefore granted by the United States onto the said Evander Howe the tract of land above described: the Have and To Hold the said tract of land with the appurtenances thereof unto the said Evander Howe and to his heirs and assigns forever.


> In testimony whereof I, Ulysses S. Grant, President of the United States of America, have caused these letters to be made Patent, and the Seal of the General and Office to be hereunto affixed.

>Given under my hand, at the City of Washington, the first day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy, and of the Independence of the United States the ninety fourth.

> By the president (signed) U.S. Grant, by (signed) Charles White, Sec'y, (signed) J.N. Granger, Recorder of the General Land Office.

To show where Evander Howeâ€™s homestead was located, I have included a map at the beginning of this section/ In the map sections 10 and 15 in township 1 north, range 1 east are drawn in black. The blue Evander Howe square, half a mile by half a mile, in the southwest corner is bounded by what is now Interstate Avenue, Kerby Avenue, Killingsworth Street, and Rosa Parks Way. Parts are in modern Piedmont (within the red boundaries), parts are in Humboldt, Overlook, and Arbor Lodge. 

### Sales

Evander Howe sold eighty acres on July, 5 1870 for four hundred dollars to Elizabeth Smith, who, together with her husband George Smith, owned the 160 acres to the east since March 10, 1866. The eighty acres Evander sold to the Smiths were the lower half of the blue quadrant, i.e. the part in modern Humboldt and Overlook. 


> Know all men by these Presents: That I Evander Howe in consideration of four Hundred Dollars to me paid by Elizabeth Smith do hereby bargain, sell, and convey to said Elizabeth Smith her heirs and assigns forever the following described parcel of real estate to wit: the South half of West Quarter of Section fifteen in Township one North range one East and bounded as follows. Commencing at the South West corner of Section fifteen and running North eighty rods thence running east one hundred and sixty rods thence South eighty rods thence West one hundred and sixty rods to place of beginning containing eighty acres said property is located in the County of Multnomah State of Oregon. _

Evander Howe did not sell the other half in his lifetime. Or, to be more precise, he sold it for forty dollars on July 12, 1870 to John Hotts, his neighbor, a retired farmer on the Columbia, who went into real estate transactions later in life. And then he bought it back from Hotts for one hundred dollars on November 5 of that year. Here is the text of the deeds. First from Howe to Hotts.


> Know all men by these Presents: That I Evander Howe of Multnomah County Ogn in consideration of Forty Dollars to me paid by John Hotts of same place. Do hereby bargain, sell, and convey to said John Hotts his heirs and assigns forever the following described parcel of real estate to wit: the North half of the South west Quarter of Section fifteen (15) in Township One North Range One East containing eighty acres in Multnomah County State of Oregon. 


> To Have and to hold the same with all the privileges and appurtenances thereto belonging to the said John Hotts his heirs and assigns forever. And I do covenant with the said John Hotts and his legal representatives forever, that the said premises are free from all encumbrance and that I will and my heirs, executors and administrators shall Warrant and Defend the same to the said John Hotts his heirs and assigns forever, against the lawful claims and demands of all persons whatsoever. In Witness Whereof I have hereto set my hand and seal this Twelfth day of July A.D. 1870. (signed) Evander Howe_

Then from Hotts to Howe.

> Know all men by these Presents:** **That I John Hotts of Multnomah County Oregon in consideration of One Hundred Dollars to me paid by Evander Howe do hereby bargain, sell, and convey to said Evander Howe his heirs and assigns forever the following described parcel of real estate to wit: the North half of the South west Quarter of Section fifteen (15) in Township One North Range One East containing eighty acres in Multnomah County Oregon.

Evander Howe died childless, a lifelong bachelor. In the _Vermont Watchman and State Journal_ of January 17, 1883, we see the following announcement.

As a direct result of this there are three deeds, all dated February 5, 1883, in which the heirs of Evander Howe deed the northern 80 acres to George Woodward of Portland, for the total sum of $ 8000. It looks like George Woodward traveled east to find these heirs. The text of the deeds Is given below. The first one, signed by Hannibal and Maria Howe, is


> Know all men by these presents, that we Hannibal F. Howe, a brother of Evander Howe late of Multnomah County Oregon deceased, and Maria M. Howe, wife of said Hannibal F. Howe, both of Jamaica in the County of Windham and State of Vermont, in consideration of the sum of Two Thousand Dollars to us paid by George Woodward of the City of Portland in the County of Multnomah in the State of Oregon, the receipt of which we hereby acknowledge, do hereby convey, remise, release and forever quitclaim unto the said George Woodward his heirs and assigns all that tract or parcel of land situated in said County of Multnomah in said State of Oregon described as follows: viz: All of the north half of the south west of section numbered fifteen (15) in Township numbered One (1) north of Range One (1) east of the Willamette Meridian containing eighty acres more or less; meaning to convey all the land that the said Evander Howe deceased was possessed of at the time of his decease in said Section fifteen (15) Township One (1) north Range One (1) east, with all the privileges and appurtenances thereunto belonging.

The second one, signed by Ezra and Etta Howe, is identical, except for the different names of the grantors, and the fact that they lived in Brattleboro, County of Windham. The first two deeds were notarized in Vermont.

The third deed, notarized in Connecticut, starts with 


> Know all men by these presents, that we Lovina A. Sweet, a sister of Evander Howe late of Multnomah County, Oregon, deceased and Edward H. Sweet, husband of said Lovina H., and Sarah L. Yance, a sister of said Evander Howe, deceased, and Lorenzo Yance, husband of said Sarah L., all of Meriden, in the County of New Haven, in the State of Connecticut, in consideration of the sum of Four Thousand Dollars ..._

Eugene Snyder (1989, p. 114) says a brother Estey Howe from Battleboro, Vermont, inherited the whole 80 acres, worth $ 6000, but that is incorrect. There is no Estey Howe, I think. Also, there is no Battleboro in Vermont, although there is a Brattleboro. Snyder was misinformed by the [Evander Howe probate file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xs6X_Qrkn7oQ42qUxIBs0PgluGlfWPlM), which mentions one Estey Howe as a possible sole heir. As we have seen, that should be  Ezra Howe, and there were others.

On December 27, 1883  George Woodward and Ellen M. Woodward, his wife, quitclaimed for one dollar an undivided one-third interest in the northern 80 acres to assembly and councilman Sylvester Farrell, of Everding & Farrell, a huge wholesale produce, shopping, grain, salmon, and logging company. And on the same day they also transferred another undivided one-third interest in the northern half of the southwest quarter to local undertaker and capitalist Edward Holman for another dollar.

August 17, 1887 a one-third interest was transferred from Farrell to Everding & Farrell for $ 2,500.

On January 3, 1890 S. Farrell and Edward Holman sold their undivided two-thirds interest to W. K. Smith for $ 26,666.66.

Finally, on January 16, 1918 Everding & Farrell sold their one third interest to the Ukase Investment Co for the nominal sum of \$ 1.

[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kkzW2tZrt2BnMOHI0Hi8BiZWxaxC2PnS](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kkzW2tZrt2BnMOHI0Hi8BiZWxaxC2PnS)

From 1918 on the Ukase Investment Company controlled the complete 80 acres in the northern half of the south west quadrant of section 15. The land had increased in value from 
\$ 100 in 1870 to \$ 40,000 in 1890. Of course very little of that appreciation benefited Evander Howe, although some of it benefited his heirs in Vermont.

In other places in this book I will discuss what the Ukase Investment Company did with their 80 acres. They leased some of the land to Harry Bush for Evergreen Park and to the City for the Municipal Automobile Park. They sold some of the land to the school district for Ockley Green School and to the City for Peninsula Park. And they used 25 of the 80 acres to plat and develop the Gainsborough Addition.

As we have seen the southern half of Evander Howeâ€™s quadrant was not in Piedmont. The eastern part of this southern half became West Piedmont and Jarrettâ€™s Addition, the western part became North Albina.
