<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> The Map</h2>
<p>The map above shows those donation lands and homesteads the United States handed out and sold around 1850-1860 that cover the Piedmont neighborhood (which is the area within the red boundaries). There is only a small number of them, five or so, and the large parcels (in the blue lines) in most cases also overlap with the adjacent neighborhoods Woodlawn, Overlook, Humboldt, King, Arbor Lodge, Kenton, and East Columbia. I shall use the generic name “homesteads” for these properties, although not all of them were authorized by the homestead act, and not all the original grantees actually homesteaded on them.</p>
<p>To put this in a larger context, here is the map of the 1860 survey of all of Township 1 of Range 1 east, which covers all of Portland, including East Portland and Albina.</p>

<p>The township and range terminology will be discussed later in this introductory chapter, in the section on the Public Land Survey System.</p>
</div>
<div id="our-discussion" class="section level2" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Our Discussion</h2>
<p>Each of our homestead chapters is divided into two parts. In the first part I discuss the land, how it was obtained, partitioned, and sold. In the second part I discuss the biographical information I have on the settlers who claimed the land and obtained the patents from the US government. The order of the two parts reflects the emphasis in this book on the ownership of the land, the persons are in some sense accidental, no matter how interesting their lives may have been. But sometimes the division between the land dealings and the life are somewhat artificial, because basically what we know about some of the homesteaders is precisely that they homesteaded in what is now the Piedmont neighborhood. And not much more.</p>
<p>How the land changed hands covers a period from the original claim to the point, often some fifty years later, when the final subdivisions were platted and the plats recorded with Multnomah County. Some plats have hundreds of lots, and it is not feasible to find out and document how individual lots were sold by the original sellers, and then later by the various owners along the way. So I stop at the subdivision level, although there are some exceptions because there is land that was not platted, and there are some lots and buildings on the land with historical significance.</p>
<p>Snyder’s 1989 book “<em>We Claimed This Land: Portland Pioneer Settlers</em>” is impressive, because it covers 212 “pioneers”, defined as persons or families who “were the first to settle on the land that is now occupied by the city of Portland, Oregon.” (1989, preface, page v). But 212 biographies in a book of 278 pages implies that some of them will be very short. Especially because some of the pioneers do get a lot of pages. A. P. Dennison, for example, inexplicably gets 22 pages, which is definitely not proportional to his historical importance. Moreover, Snyder concentrates on pioneers associated with the original site of the City of Portland, on the west side of the Willamette, and on the more urban tracts. This makes perfect sense, because information about them is more readily available. Our Piedmont pioneers Evander Howe (10 lines), George Smith (9 lines), and David Ulery (12 lines) are given short shrift, simply because Snyder does not have more information on them. And some of the information is incorrect or imprecise. Captain Lewis Love gets three pages, which is still not much for such a long and eventful life. John Fenstermacher gets a full page, but mostly because of the tabloid aspects of his life and death. Because we only have to consider just four or five pioneers we can dig much deeper, and find more (and more correct) information.</p>
<p>We freely use the words “pioneers” and “settlers”, although both words have plenty of negative connotations these days (Sakai, 2014). The words seem to suggest that the white people who came from the east arrived on virgin land (the terra nullius doctrine), which was waiting to be occupied, utilized, monetarized, and exploited. The alternative interpretation of what took place in the early nineteenth century is, of course, that all that land was invaded and occupied, and the original inhabitants, the ones that did not succumb to the infectious diseases brought by the settlers, were forcibly removed and in many instances killed. As a rule the white settlers seem to have been brave, daring, inventive, hard working, and incredibly resistant to many kinds of adversity. They came to improve their situation, and many who came early succeeded in doing just that. Their improvement was made possible, however, by the racism, exceptionalism, and manifest destiny ideologies promoted by the ruling classes. And we should not forget they were, wittingly or unwittingly, part of a racist and colonialist invasion that resulted in an horrific genocide (Dunbar-Ortiz, 2014)</p>
</div>
<div id="land-laws" class="section level2" number="2.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Land Laws</h2>
<p>There were multiple laws passed by Congress in the eighteenth and nineteenth century on which the various donations and patents are based. Some of them were actually donations, which means the settlers did not have to pay anything for the land, and some were for-pay, although always for very little money.</p>
<p>Because nothing beats looking at the original documents, in the exact language they were written in, I provide links to the actual laws. In the references at the end of the chapter there are links to Wikipedia articles that provide at least some background. If you want to know more about how the United States disposed on its public lands through a whole sequence of homestead type acts, there is the authoritative article by <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TT_lgoh_nI8LSdztGw_claFQYfHje16G">Bien (1910)</a>. For an even more extensive discussion of the donations of various types in Oregon (including giveaways to railroads, timber harvesting, or military wagon roads) see the dissertation by <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T8HRj39qobQ_4NkydJpagwnRQvFPAEUB">Jerry O’Callaghan (1951)</a>.</p>

<p>On the map at the beginning of this chapter Lewis Love and John Rankin used the Oregon Donation Land Act of 1850. John Fenstermacher and Evander Howe used the Homestead Act of 1862 (which means they had to pay for their land). George Smith, Robert Maxey, and David Ulery used the Military Bounty Act of 1855. In all three cases, however, they were not the ones doing the actual military service. By informal and and by now unknowable transactions they made the original military men sign over their patents, undoubtedly for a pittance.</p>
<p>The Oregon Donation Land Act of 1850 deserves some additional attention, because it is specific to our region. The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B94Urj3OjM7BcWhIYmUtV0htcms">Genealogical Forum of Oregon (2014)</a> has a nice brochure, with the essential facts. Also quite readable is the page on the act of the<a href="https://oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/oregon-land-donation-claim-notification/#.WriRZS-ZPDY">Oregon History Project (2018)</a>.</p>

<div id="public-land-survey-system" class="section level2" number="2.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Public Land Survey System</h2>
<p>The _Rectangular Survey System** **_was created by the Land Ordinance of 1785. It covers the United States with squares of 6 by 6 miles. It then introduces a local coordinate system by designating a vertical lines (meridian) and horizontal line (base line). In our case the vertical line is the Willamette Meridian, running through the hills west of Portland, and the horizontal line is the Willamette base line, along Base Line Street (now Stark Street). The two intersect at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willamette_Stone">Willamette Stone</a>. This local coordinate system allows one to code the squares, indicating how many squares east or west of the meridian, and how many squares north or south of the base line they are. The figure below, taken from page 25 of the <a href="https://www.blm.gov/or/landsrealty/glo200/files/glo-book.pdf">excellent e-book by Vaughan (2014)</a>, show both meridian and base line.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/02_images/image3.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="" />
<p class="caption">alt_text</p>
</div>
<p>On the map at the beginning of this chapter you see modern Piedmont in the red boundaries. The black squares are sections 9, 10, 15, and 16 of Township 1 North, Range 1 East (T 1N R 1E), i.e. the first square north of the baseline and east of the meridian.</p>
<p>A township in PLSS is six by six miles, with 36 sections. Thus T 1N R 1E covers most of Portland. A black section is a square mile, or 640 acres, and the four quarters of a section (NE, SE, SW, NW) are each 160 acres. The following figure, from page 28, of <a href="https://www.blm.gov/or/landsrealty/glo200/files/glo-book.pdf">Vaughan (2014)</a>, illustrates the basics.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/02_images/image4.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="" />
<p class="caption">alt_text</p>
</div>
<p>The rectangular system is used throughout to locate parcels of land, where basically each of the townships provides another even more local coordinate system. We can now say, for example, that a piece of land in the figure above is the SE ¼ of the NW quadrant of Section 14 in township 4 south of range 3 west. Even more importantly, parcels of land, especially in the homestead period, are often defined as sections or quarters of the system, and as a consequence roads often align with boundaries of quarters as well.</p>

</div>
<div id="surveyors-lengths" class="section level2" number="2.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Surveyors Lengths</h2>
<p>In many of the deeds from the nineteenth century parcels of land are described in the language of surveyors, and the boundaries are described in the units of length used by surveyors around that time. Since these units may be unfamiliar to modern readers, I briefly summarize definitions of the most common ones, and show how to translate them into feet and even meters.</p>
<pre><code>_The name **furlong** derives from the [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English_language) words furh (furrow) and lang (long). Dating back at least to early [Anglo-Saxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon) times, it originally referred to the length of the furrow in one [acre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre) of a ploughed [open field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-field_system) (a medieval communal field which was divided into strips). _


_A **chain** is a [unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement) of [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length) that measures 66 [feet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)), 22 [yards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yard_(unit_of_length)), 100 [links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_(unit)),&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;or 4 [rods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_(unit)) (20.1168 [m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre)). There are 10 chains in a [furlong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furlong), and 80 chains in one [statute mile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_mile). An [acre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre) is the area of 10 square chains (that is, an area of one chain by one furlong). _


_The **rod** or perch or pole is a [surveyor’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying) tool&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;and unit of [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length) equal to ​5 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [yards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yard), 16​&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [feet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(length)), ​&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;320&lt;/sub&gt; of a [statute mile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_mile) or one-fourth of a [surveyor&#39;s chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_(unit)) and 5.0292 [meters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter).

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.7</span> Deeds and Patents</h2>
<p>This book contains excerpts from, transcripts of, and links to hundreds of deeds. There are many types of deeds, which are used to register the transfer of real property. There are hundreds of introductions to deeds and types of ownership of real property of the web. A good example is <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/law_trends_news_practice_area_e_newsletter_home/2011_summer/real_property_interests_deeds.html">American Bar Association (2011)</a>. I only give a brief summary of the types we will encounter in this book.</p>
<p>A <em>general warranty deed</em> guarantees that the grantor has clear title, and that no other parties retain an interest in the property. It usually includes various covenants, in particular that the grantor is responsible if it is discovered the title is not clear and third parties makes claims to the property.</p>
<p>A_ quitclaim deed_ transfers any interest in the real property that the grantee has to the grantor, without any guarantee that the grantee actually has title to or ownership of the property. Thus the rights of the grantor in the property are transferred to the grantee, provided that the grantor actually has these rights, otherwise the quitclaim deed is just a piece of paper.</p>
<p>A <em>sheriff’s deed</em> is a deed that gives ownership rights in property bought at a sheriff’s sale. A sheriff’s sale is a sale conducted by a sheriff upon order of a court after a failure to pay a judgment. These days sheriff’s deeds are used in foreclosures, in the nineteenth century they were used even more often if owners of real property failed to pay taxes or bills for goods and services. The important thing is that a court order was needed. Old newspapers have pages and pages of pieces of real estate sold at sheriff’s sales, mostly because of delinquent property taxes.</p>
<p>For US land donations and cash transactions under the homestead law we include and transcribe (in as far as they are readable) a copy of the patent and the corresponding deed. For later transfers of real property we include copies, or links to copies, of all deeds we could find. For this chapter we follow the title chain from the US to the homesteader, and then from the homesteader to all next-stage buyers, until the whole homestead is divided up and sold, and we arrive at the subdivision plats, which eventually all will have their separate chapters in this book.</p>
<p>As usual, links to deeds are included, and some deeds, or parts of deeds, are transcribed in the text. Because of the nineteenth century longhand, and because of the quality of the copies and microfilm, it is sometimes impossible to read part of the deed. Also, deeds are to a large extent written in legal language, portions of which are almost the same for all deeds in a certain period. In some cases we skip the boiler plate and only transcribe the variable portions. Finally, we do not transcribe the notarization of the deed, although that is typically included in the linked file.</p>

<p>On June 1, 1870, Evander Howe established a claim under the homestead act of 1862 for 160 acres of land, the southwest corner of section 15 in township 1 north, range 1 east. Snyder tells us he paid $ 200. That makes sense because under the provisions of the act land was sold for $ 1.25 per acre. The complete transcribed text of the patent (General Land Office Record, 1870) follows.</p>
<pre><code>_Whereas there has been deposited in the General Land Office of the United States a certificate of the Register of the Land Office at Oregon City, whereby it appears that pursuing to the Act of Congress approved the 20th of May 1862 &quot;To Secure Homesteads to actual Settlers on the public domain&quot;, and the acts supplemental thereto, the claim of Evander Howe has been established and duly consummated in conformity to law for the South West quarter of Section fifteen in Township one North of Range one East in this District of Lands subject to Sale at Oregon City Oregon containing one hundred and sixty acres according to the Official Plat of the Survey of the said Land returned to the General Land Office by the Surveyor General._


_Now know ye, that there is therefore granted by the United States onto the said Evander Howe the tract of land above described: the Have and To Hold the said tract of land with the appurtenances thereof unto the said Evander Howe and to his heirs and assigns forever._


_In testimony whereof I, Ulysses S. Grant, President of the United States of America, have caused these letters to be made Patent, and the Seal of the General and Office to be hereunto affixed._


_Given under my hand, at the City of Washington, the first day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy, and of the Independence of the United States the ninety fourth._


_By the president (signed) U.S. Grant, by (signed) Charles White, Sec&#39;y, (signed) J.N. Granger, Recorder of the General Land Office._</code></pre>

<p>To show where Evander Howe’s homestead was located, I have included a map at the beginning of this chapter. In the map sections 10 and 15 in township 1 north, range 1 east are drawn in black. The blue Evander Howe square, half a mile by half a mile, in the southwest corner is bounded by what is now Interstate Avenue, Kerby Avenue, Killingsworth Street, and Rosa Parks Way. Parts are in modern Piedmont (within the red boundaries), parts are in Humboldt, Overlook, and Arbor Lodge.</p>

<p>Evander Howe sold eighty acres on July, 5 1870 for four hundred dollars to Elizabeth Smith, who, together with her husband George Smith, owned the 160 acres to the east since March 10, 1866. The eighty acres Evander sold to the Smiths were the lower half of the blue quadrant, i.e. the part in modern Humboldt and Overlook.</p>
<pre><code>_Know all men by these Presents: That I Evander Howe in consideration of four Hundred Dollars to me paid by Elizabeth Smith do hereby bargain, sell, and convey to said Elizabeth Smith her heirs and assigns forever the following described parcel of real estate to wit: the South half of West Quarter of Section fifteen in Township one North range one East and bounded as follows.

<p>Evander Howe did not sell the other half in his lifetime. Or, to be more precise, he sold it for forty dollars on July 12, 1870 to John Hotts, his neighbor, a retired farmer on the Columbia, who went into real estate transactions later in life. And then he bought it back from Hotts for one hundred dollars on November 5 of that year. Here is the text of the deeds. First from Howe to Hotts.</p>
<pre><code>_Know all men by these Presents: That I Evander Howe of Multnomah County Ogn in consideration of Forty Dollars to me paid by John Hotts of same place.

<p>Evander Howe died childless, a lifelong bachelor. In the _Vermont Watchman and State Journal _of January 17, 1883, we see the following announcement.</p>

<p>As a direct result of this there are three deeds, all dated February 5, 1883, in which the heirs of Evander Howe deed the northern 80 acres to George Woodward of Portland, for the total sum of $ 8000. It looks like George Woodward traveled east to find these heirs. The text of the deeds Is given below. The first one, signed by Hannibal and Maria Howe, is</p>
<pre><code>_Know all men by these presents, that we Hannibal F. Howe, a brother of Evander Howe late of Multnomah County Oregon deceased, and Maria M. Howe, wife of said Hannibal F. Howe, both of Jamaica in the County of Windham and State of Vermont, in consideration of the sum of Two Thousand Dollars to us paid by George Woodward of the City of Portland in the County of Multnomah in the State of Oregon, the receipt of which we hereby acknowledge, do hereby convey, remise, release and forever quitclaim unto the said George Woodward his heirs and assigns all that tract or parcel of land situated in said County of Multnomah in said State of Oregon described as follows: viz: All of the north half of the south west of section numbered fifteen (15) in Township numbered One (1) north of Range One (1) east of the Willamette Meridian containing eighty acres more or less; meaning to convey all the land that the said Evander Howe deceased was possessed of at the time of his decease in said Section fifteen (15) Township One (1) north Range One (1) east, with all the privileges and appurtenances thereunto belonging._


_To Have and To Hold the above granted and bargained premises to the said George Woodward his heirs and assigns, to his and their use benefit and behoof forever. And me the said Hannibal F. Howe and Maria M. Howe for ourselves our heirs executors and administrators do covenant with the said George Woodward his heirs and assigns hat the premises are free from all encumbrances made or suffered by us, and that we will, and our heirs, executors, and administrators shall warrant and defend the same to the said George Woodward his heirs and assigns forever against lawful claims of all persons claiming by, through, or under us, but against none other. In witness whereof we have hereunto set our hands and seals this 5th day of February AD 1883. (signed) Hannibal F. Howe (signed) Maria M. Howe_

<p>The second one, signed by Ezra and Etta Howe, is identical, except for the different names of the grantors, and the fact that they lived in Brattleboro, County of Windham. The first two deeds were notarized in Vermont.</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wxfhNyWLkp815Ko7rQcvGhNBFBzQWCwW">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wxfhNyWLkp815Ko7rQcvGhNBFBzQWCwW</a></p>
<p>The third deed, notarized in Connecticut, starts with</p>
<pre><code>_Know all men by these presents, that we Lovina A. Sweet, a sister of Evander Howe late of Multnomah County, Oregon, deceased and Edward H. Sweet, husband of said Lovina H., and Sarah L. Yance, a sister of said Evander Howe, deceased, and Lorenzo Yance, husband of said Sarah L., all of Meriden, in the County of New Haven, in the State of Connecticut, in consideration of the sum of Four Thousand Dollars ..._</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CZDyWK0AwXhS4wodoqFr5P4mZ8O4tltb">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CZDyWK0AwXhS4wodoqFr5P4mZ8O4tltb</a></p>
<p>Eugene Snyder (1989, p. 114) says a brother Estey Howe from Battleboro, Vermont, inherited the whole 80 acres, worth $ 6000, but that is incorrect. There is no Estey Howe, I think. Also, there is no Battleboro in Vermont, although there is a Brattleboro. Snyder was misinformed by the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xs6X_Qrkn7oQ42qUxIBs0PgluGlfWPlM">Evander Howe probate file</a>, which mentions one Estey Howe as a possible sole heir. As we have seen, that should be Ezra Howe, and there were others.</p>
<p>On December 27, 1883 George Woodward and Ellen M. Woodward, his wife, quitclaimed for one dollar an undivided one-third interest in the northern 80 acres to assembly and councilman Sylvester Farrell, of Everding &amp; Farrell, a huge wholesale produce, shopping, grain, salmon, and logging company. And on the same day they also transferred another undivided one-third interest in the northern half of the southwest quarter to local undertaker and capitalist Edward Holman for another dollar.</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uheS9b7nigCNVkVcf4-3Ve6vU0F7mASU">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uheS9b7nigCNVkVcf4-3Ve6vU0F7mASU</a></p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_inDXj_kQkbhkHclvA2Fw-oLh-jv_QzC">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_inDXj_kQkbhkHclvA2Fw-oLh-jv_QzC</a></p>
<p>August 17, 1887 a one-third interest was transferred from Farrell to Everding &amp; Farrell for $ 2,500.</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LqahDe7DqF0VmlcNryMhDq1OUgd9WXNK">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LqahDe7DqF0VmlcNryMhDq1OUgd9WXNK</a></p>
<p>On January 3, 1890 S. Farrell and Edward Holman sold their undivided two-thirds interest to W. K. Smith for $ 26,666.66.</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=16X24Gs1i2tG0iPP8j7WRHGVSS9nJcluZ">https://drive.google.com/open?id=16X24Gs1i2tG0iPP8j7WRHGVSS9nJcluZ</a></p>
<p>Finally, on January 16, 1918 Everding &amp; Farrell sold their one third interest to the Ukase Investment Co for the nominal sum of $ 1.</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kkzW2tZrt2BnMOHI0Hi8BiZWxaxC2PnS">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kkzW2tZrt2BnMOHI0Hi8BiZWxaxC2PnS</a></p>
<p>From 1918 on the Ukase Investment Company controlled the complete 80 acres in the northern half of the south west quadrant of section 15. The land had increased in value from</p>
<p>$ 100 in 1870 to $ 40,000 in 1890. Of course very little of that appreciation benefited Evander Howe, although some of it benefited his heirs in Vermont.</p>
<p>In other places in this book I will discuss what the Ukase Investment Company did with their 80 acres. They leased some of the land to Harry Bush for Evergreen Park and to the City for the Municipal Automobile Park. They sold some of the land to the school district for Ockley Green School and to the City for Peninsula Park. And they used 25 of the 80 acres to plat and develop the Gainsborough Addition.</p>
<p>As we have seen the southern half of Evander Howe’s quadrant was not in Piedmont. The eastern part of this southern half became West Piedmont and Jarrett’s Addition, the western part became North Albina.</p>

<p>In the 1860s Evander Howe came from Vermont to Oregon. He does not appear even once in any of the Oregon newspapers from the time period. Eugene E. Snyder _(1989, p. 114) _says</p>
<pre><code>_No record tells us what sort of man Evander Howe was, nor how he occupied his time in Oregon._</code></pre>
<p>As I began this research it was unclear when and where he was born and how old he was when he died. There is not much information, but there is a bit more than nothing.</p>
<p>Snyder mentions he has no idea what Howe tried or did during his final years, or if he was even in Portland. But I found him in the 1880 census. He was enumerated on July 14, a 45 year old farmer living in the Willamette Precinct. The name was transcribed as Evanden, but the census form is pretty clear. His neighbor on the form is the 52 year old farmer John Hott (sic). That should actually be John Hotts. Both of them were single. Evander apparently lived alone, Hotts had a hired hand living at the same address. Another neighbor on the same census form is Davis Ulery (sic), a 49 year old farmer, with a large family. That should actually be David Ulery.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.17</span> Death</h2>
<p>Snyder tells us Evander Howe died in 1882. Initially, I was not able to find the precise date of death, or the location of the grave. But there is much useful information, as is often the case, in the probate file (Case number 858, Multnomah Court Records, 56 pages).</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xs6X_Qrkn7oQ42qUxIBs0PgluGlfWPlM">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xs6X_Qrkn7oQ42qUxIBs0PgluGlfWPlM</a></p>
<p>As I have remarked elsewhere, probate files and cemetery records often make it easier to find out facts about a person’s death than about their life. This is partly because they arrived from different places, but they all died in Portland. Also, their birth and childhood often were lived in areas that were not yet incorporated and did not have state, county, or city administrative offices. And thirdly, there is just more bureaucratic and journalistic activity around estates and deaths than around births or marriages, partly because often the heirs tend to get into elaborate fights amongst themselves. This is, of course, especially true for large estates, because greed needs a substrate to grow on.</p>
<p>So what did I learn from the probate file ? Evander Howe died intestate on June 24, 1882. Thus the court had to appoint an administrator to oversee the appraisal and distribution of the estate. In order to get the job potential administrators petition the court for an appointment, usually pointing out why they were especially suited for the position. In Howe’s case there were two petitioners. The first was R. G. Rex M.D. who was “one of the principal creditors of said deceased”. Also Dr. Rex had some pertinent information. In his petition he gave the precise description of Evander’s real estate, and its estimated value of $ 8,000, and he knew of the existence of “ a brother names Estey Howe residing at or near Brattleboro in Windham County in the State of Vermont.” Nevertheless Dr. Rex lost out to Edward Holman, the funeral and cremation provider, who ran “the second oldest business in Portland”, since 1854. The business still exists. See their website at <a href="https://www.holmansfuneralservice.com">https://www.holmansfuneralservice.com</a>. There was a great deal of money in funerals, it seems, and Holman became a capitalist, and a very prominent citizen of Portland. Note that soon after he would actually own a half interest in Evander’s land.I don’t think Dr. Rex stood a chance, even though he knew the deceased and Holman did not.</p>
<p>In his petition Holman mentioned that Evander Howe had no family in Oregon, or anywhere else, as far as he knew. But he did mention he was the principal creditor of the estate. The firm of A.P. De Lin &amp; Co, of which he was a member, was owned $ 128.00 for funeral services. The bill in question is below. It does not say where the grave was, and I still do not know where A.P. De Lin &amp; Co. generally disposed of the bodies.</p>

<p>Being an administrator required one to agree to a financial penalty if the court found the duties of the administrator were not carried out or the powers of the administrator were not misused. In the Evander Howe case Holman had to agree to a penal sum of $ 12,000. He used two sureties, Levi Anderson and councilman Sylvester Farrell, each for $ 6,000. Note again that soon after Sylvester Farrell would own a half interest in Evander’s land.</p>
<p>The appraisers were D.W. Wakefield, L.L. Parrish, and T.J. Mattock. They concluded, probably without actually looking at anything, on August 11, 1882 that there was $ 200.00 of cash and $ 8,500.00 of real property (the northern half of the southwest quarter of section 15). In his final report, of August 24, 1882, Holman adds $ 12.45 from the sale of potatoes (which were a common part of agricultural estates) and $ 28.62 from the sale of an old stove and some other personal property. He paid some outstanding bills and charged additional costs to the estate, including a $ 150.00 appraiser fee for himself and a $ 100.00 fee for his lawyer. Here is the list.</p>
<p>Clearly Evander Howe lived a minimalist and environmentally responsible life on his piece of the Vancouver Road.</p>

<p>What follows in the probate file are copies of the bills, and various notices from the creditors that the bills were duly paid. More interesting for our purposes is a later note, notarized on March 22, 1883, and written by Edward Holman’s attorney to Judge Stearns. It shows that George Woodward, perhaps taking a hint from the petition of Dr. Rex, had found the family.</p>
<p>Edward Holman, Sylvester Farrell, and W. K. Smith were waiting in the wings to start buying and selling the land.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.18</span> Family</h2>
<p>We have seen earlier that Evander’s family lived in Vermont. In the 1850 <em>Federal Census</em> I found Joseph Gilman Howe, a farmer, born 1809, married to Priscilla Howe (née Spalding) and living in Jamaica, Windham County, Vermont. They have five children living at home: Evander, age 15, Hannibal, age 12, Louisa, age 10, Lovina, age 7, and Sarah, age 4. Thus Evander was the oldest son. The <em>Vermont Vital Records</em> show his birth date was March 12, 1834. It also shows the middle initial T. which disappeared over time.</p>

<p>Evander’s profession at 15 was listed by the census as farmer, like his dad. In the 1860 census Evander (transcribed as Elander) was 24, still living at home, a laborer. There is now also an eight year old brother Ezra Olander Howe.</p>
<p>I also found a record in the <em>Minnesota Territorial Census</em> of September 21, 1857, showing an Evander Howe, age 23, born in Vermont in 1834, living in Township 109 in the County of Nicollet. He was a laborer on the farm of Luke Rist, who was also from Vermont. And in the <em>Minnesota Homestead and Cash Entry Patents</em> Evander Howe bought 27.62 acres of land in Blue Earth, Nicollet County, on October 1, 1860. The land office that handled the sale was in St Peter, another town in Nicollet County. Even more impressively, on December 3, 1860, Sarah Knecht, formerly the widow of Henry Stone, who was a private in Captain Wilson’s Company of the Pennsylvania Militia in the War of 1812, used the Military Bounty Act of 1855 to claim 120 acres of land in Nicollet County. She then assigned the warrant to H.W. Lamberton, who subsequently passed it on to Evander Howe. So clearly around this time Evander was moving west and had acquired some property on the way. I have copies of both patent deeds, but since they are a bit far from our bed, and transcribing them is boring, I will just give the URLs in the references. I have no idea what Evander did between 1860 and 1870.</p>
<p>In the 1880 census Joseph G. Howe is a widower, who lives with his daughter-in-law Maria and two grandchildren, still in Jamaica, Vermont. There is no sign of Hannibal, Maria’s husband. It is mentioned in the census that Joseph is sick of old age. He died 1882, 74 years old, in the same year as his oldest son Evander. The <em>Vermont Probate Records</em> of 1882 show that the administrator of his estate asks permission of the probate court to sell all real estate belonging to the deceased to satisfy his debtors. There is a debt of $ 698.77 and a personal estate of only $ 8.50. The 8000 dollars that Geo. Woodward paid to Evander Howe’s siblings came too late to help Joseph Howe.</p>
