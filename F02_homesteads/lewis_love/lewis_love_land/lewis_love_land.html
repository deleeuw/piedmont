The copy of the patent is hard to read, so I have transcribed what I could decipher below.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Whereas there has been deposited in the GENERAL LAND OFFICE of the UNITED STATES a Certificate numbered Fourteen hundred and eighty-four of the Register and Receiver at Oregon City, Oregon whereby it appears that under the provisions of the act of Congress approved the 27th day of September 1850, entitled &ldquo;An Act to create the office of Surveyor General of the Public Lands in Oregon and to provide for the survey and to make donations to settlers of the said public lands&rdquo; and the legislation supplemental thereto the claim of Lewis Love and his wife Nancy M.

He also sold these properties, often making a large profit. But his original donation land claim remained intact, in fact it grew somewhat over the years. He did not sell, and he seemed to fiercely protect its integrity. But after his death in 1903, everything went pear shaped. He had made a will in 1899 (see </span><span class="c7"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pLI6licAfG6i3ooBr-95lArIwOkYXDUm16BpxombkAA&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1630355128309000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0BhLnnmt3chzjSXmwz7NqN">De Leeuw, 2018</a></span><span class="c0">). His heirs were prohibited by the will from selling their shares of the estate until 1907, but they immediately started to convert land to money. In fact, some of them sold their claims to the estate that were defined in the will, even if it was not executed yet.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To understand the division of the land the will indicates the parcel was about 750 acres. Initially the executors of the will T. T. Struble and Philo Holbrook tried to sell the whole tract. It is unclear to me if they were required to do this by law, or if the heirs had decided it is easier to divide up money than it is to divide up land. In any case, here are two ads from the Oregonian of March 31, 1903 and March 1, 1907.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 305.07px; height: 183.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 305.07px; height: 183.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 301.70px; height: 213.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 301.70px; height: 213.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now $ 500 per acre would make the tract $ 375,000 -- a gigantic amount of money in 1903. The usual inflation calculators show that this would be about ten million dollars in 2018. But on the other hand, those ten million dollars in 2018 will barely buy you 25 houses in the modern Piedmont neighborhood.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Selling the whole 750 acres as a single tract did not work, and the executors had to divide up the land. Now I am not sure how this was actually done, but given the final results I can make a fair guess. Lewis and Nancy Love had four surviving children (Fred, Lewis, Green, Mary) and two deceased children with progeny (William, Malinda). Thus the estate was divided in six parts, with the surviving children getting one sixth each, and the grandchildren dividing up the two other sixths that would have come to their parents. If we ignore the other real estate and the personal property, then each sixth would be about 120 acres. This corresponds with the six vertical strips of about 120 acres that were later platted and subdivided from west to east as Fairview (from Minnesota to Albina), Swinton (from Albina to Kerby), Lovewood plus Green C. Love Addition (from Kerby to Vancouver), Loveleigh (from Vancouver to Rodney), Love&rsquo;s Addition (From Rodney to Union), and El Tovar (from Union to Eight Street). So that&rsquo;s our model, which is probably approximate. Six vertical tracts going to the six heirs, with the two sets of grandchildren acting as a single heir. My next job is to find the deeds that either verify or falsify this model.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because there were many heirs, and because inheritances tend to make people greedy and irrational, there are many deeds to be considered. I have not found them all yet, but I&rsquo;ll continue to make a valiant effort. I will also try to indicate which piece of the original DLC was sold and to whom, all the way up to the final plat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Let&rsquo;s start with the eastern strip, which is not in Piedmont but in Woodlawn (and Sunderland). On August 12, 1908 Lewis P. Love and his wife Mattie M. Love sold the 48.19 acres bounded by Union Avenue to the west, Bryant Street to the south, Eight Street to the east, and the ONR railroad tracks to the North to Elias Brong from $ 72.000.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/open?id%3D1XV6thcd7zVAzSDaZFUUhPxiCqWBwIX69&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1630355128311000&amp;usg=AOvVaw25HaBddk0B4dbS32hh5xqJ">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XV6thcd7zVAzSDaZFUUhPxiCqWBwIX69</a></span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These 48.19 acres were platted by the Brong-Steele Company immediately after the sale on August 28, 1908 as the El Tovar subdivision.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/open?id%3D1FxOMQX-zJeRPSWraRJrK9SQ0oPhXr_TB&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1630355128312000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Iz64vdw7Nn32HSjb5Jz0X">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FxOMQX-zJeRPSWraRJrK9SQ0oPhXr_TB</a></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On October 29, 1910 they sold the remaining 52.26 acres north of the railroad tracks to the same Elias Brong for a nominal amount of $ 10.

On August 8, 1908 the plat for Love&rsquo;s Addition was filed. This was for the 46.18 acres south of the railroad, with of course Bryant as the southern boundary. The Stafford branch of the Love family did not sell to a developer first, but they themselves became the developers. The plat was filed by Mary C.
